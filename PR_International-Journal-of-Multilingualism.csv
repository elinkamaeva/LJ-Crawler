These abilities are among the most reliable indicators of children’s literacy skills. We compare two groups of emergent bilingual children with migrant background attending the fourth and fifth grade of a public primary school in Italy: 30 children were exposed to multilingual pedagogies, whereas 33 attended a ‘traditional’ monoglossic program. The results show that children exposed to multilingual pedagogies use more mental state terms in their narratives in both their home language and Italian than children exposed to monoglossic education. Furthermore children exposed to multilingual pedagogies exhibit similar patterns of use of mental state terms across the two languages. By contrast, the production of mental state terms differs across the two languages among the children exposed to monoglossic education. The qualitative analysis of the narratives shows that the home and the school language dynamically interact with each other regarding the construction of the narrative among the children exposed to multilingual pedagogies. The children attending monoglossic programs rely mostly on literal translations. The study shows that multilingual pedagogies boost emergent bilinguals’ literacy skills and enable them to access these skills from all languages in their repertoire.

However, only a few studies have focussed on positive transfer from an L2 to an L3/Ln in the context of multilingual language acquisition of Romance past tenses. The present study therefore analyses the acquisition of perfective/imperfective aspect in Spanish by 58 German-speaking multilingual learners with previous linguistic knowledge in two L2s (i.e. English and French). Data were elicited by means of a language background questionnaire, a c-test (for proficiency measures in Spanish), and three semantic interpretation tasks (used to determine the participants’ knowledge of aspect in the L2s and the target language). The findings indicate that the learners transfer the form-meaning-mappings established in (one of) their L2s, resulting in positive effects when form-meaning-mappings between the L2 and the target language(s) are similar.

We examined how implicit and explicit measures of attitudes towards Catalan and Spanish predict self-reported language use and spontaneous language choice. Participants (N = 98) completed an Implicit Association Test (IAT), self-reports of language attitudes and use, and a spontaneous language choice. Although both implicit and explicit measures correlated with the behavioural measures, the results showed that the IAT had predictive and incremental validity. Moreover, a partial dissociation pattern of prediction was identified, underscoring the importance of including implicit measures of language attitudes, as they predict variance in behaviour above and beyond what is predicted by explicit measures.

The investigation is carried out within the wider context of the worries being expressed by many speakers of Yorùbá about the status of the language with respect to language endangerment. It employs both quantitative and qualitative research designs rooted in content analysis, and examines 426 purposively sampled programmes of Rave FM and Gold FM. The programmes were sorted and content-analysed using charts. Of the 12 examined programme categories, English is the dominant language of 9 most important programmes, while Yorùbá is the dominant language of 3 programmes; thereby pointing to a gradual loss of the radio broadcast domain. The study recommends more value-added usage of the Yorùbá language in media domains to improve the language’s vitality and inclusive audience participation.

By applying different methodologies (qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods), the contributions aim to better understand teachers’ beliefs about multilingualism in a time of increasingly globalised societies and intensified migration flows. The studies cover all educational stages and include pre-service as well as in-service teachers, and teacher educators. Both individual and collective beliefs are considered. While two of the studies are cross-sectional, the other three apply a pre-post study design in order to investigate whether teachers’ beliefs can be influenced through adequate learning opportunities. The special issue is wrapped up by a commentary piece that links the findings and issues raised by the individual papers and addresses four pressing matters which should be considered to advance further research on teachers’ beliefs about multilingualism. In this editorial, we briefly introduce the concept of teachers’ beliefs and explain its relevance for teaching and learning in multilingual settings. Based on an ongoing review study, we provide a summary of the most commonly used methodologies in research on teachers’ beliefs about multilingualism.

In this paper, we discuss the results of research conducted in the Deep South of Thailand, a minority region in which the predominant language, ethnicity and religion are different from the rest of the nation, and which has over the last century been exposed to significant assimilatory pressure. Drawing on an analysis of language use in two Islamic schools in the region, as well as interviews and focus groups with administrators, teachers and students, we focus on the temporality of meanings – how schoolscapes are anchored in narratives of the past, present and future. Historical memories evoked by particular elements of the schoolscapes are discussed, particularly in light of the efforts of the local population to resist assimilatory policies. We also discuss the aspirations of our participants for the future, observing that, while recent language policy in Thailand has focussed primarily on promoting Thai and English, our participants saw a much more varied plurilingualism as relevant to their lives.

However, minimal empirical research has investigated relationships between language minority parents and caregivers in childcare. This large-scale study seeks to fill this gap by exploring the quality of the language minority parent‒caregiver relationship with a focus on the child’s multilingual upbringing. Therefore, three domains that reflect the quality of parent‒caregiver relationships were assessed: (1) interpersonal connections, (2) home‒childcare continuity, and (3) language and multilingual upbringing advice parents receive from caregivers. The sample consists of 404 language minority parents, recruited from 85 childcare facilities (0–3 years). Results indicate that most parents reported positive relationships with their child’s caregiver with respect to interpersonal characteristics (communication and trust). In contrast, parents responded less favorably regarding issues pertaining to their language expectations, including whether multilingual upbringing advice, either solicited or unsolicited, was discussed. While language advice was not frequently given, when it was given, multilingual advice was more prevalent than monolingual advice, and one-parent one-language (OPOL) advice was common. Practical and policy implications are discussed. ",International Journal of Multilingualism

This article describes a study of 72 primary school students (age = 10.68) who participated in an intervention based on translanguaging pedagogies. During the intervention, the boundaries between Basque, Spanish, and English were purposefully and systematically softened to develop the students’ communicative competence in the three languages. The study adopted a qualitative approach to explore the pedagogical validity of translanguaging. Focus group discussions were conducted as well as classroom observation in the Basque, Spanish and English language subjects. Qualitative Content Analysis was conducted to analyze the data. In addition, we analyzed translanguaging materials completed by students to gain a better understanding of their performance. The results are discussed in terms of specific translanguaging strategies designed for the intervention and show an increase in students’ metalinguistic awareness in the three languages. Students found pedagogical translanguaging useful since it facilitates language comparison and scaffolds understanding and written production. In addition, they found vocabulary strategies particularly beneficial for scaffolding foreign language learning. Finally, implications for the future development of translanguaging practices and research are briefly discussed. ",International Journal of Multilingualism

Although it may appear evident that their multilingual and multicultural identities and experiences inevitably influence their translanguaging experiences, few studies have examined how their identities affect their perspectives and practices toward translanguaging in the Canadian higher education context. Because the impact of identities on the linguistic decision-making process is often manifested in the positions individuals assign to themselves and others in social interactions, this study drew on positioning theory to investigate how the positions assigned by 17 international graduate students from the faculty of education during their studies in Canada shaped their translanguaging experiences. Analysis of the interview data indicated that the participants assigned multiple, fluid, and sometimes conflicting positions to themselves and others when participating in higher education discourses. Their evaluation of linguistic and cultural affinity with interlocutors, positioning in relation to the English language, and varied considerations as (future) teachers complicated their perspectives and performances of translanguaging. This report concluded with implications for Canadian higher education to implement an effective translanguaging-oriented pedagogy that is linguistically and culturally responsive to the increasingly diversified international student population.

At the same time, there has been a gradual increase in Chinese teachers and faculty members, as these same students continue their studies and build a life in UK academia. Ideally, this demographic shift should offer the opportunity for a flourishing multilingual and translingual academic space in UK universities. However, this is often not the case, with English remaining the default and often only option in teacher/student interactions, regardless of the linguistic and cultural background of the interlocutors. In this study, we explore the barriers to translanguaging practices between Chinese students and their Chinese dissertation supervisor. Through observation of supervisory sessions and interviews with students, we found considerable resistance to translanguaging practices involving the use of shared first language whilst in the UK learning environment. This resistance was seen to be driven by native-speakerist and monolinguistic ideologies, lack of institutional language policy, and actions and attitudes of individual students and teachers.

In this paper, we explore how code-switched data affects the task of Machine Translation, a task which only recently has started to tackle the challenge of multilingual data. We test three Machine Translation systems on data from the Canberra Vietnamese–English Codeswitching Natural Speech Corpus (CanVEC) and evaluate translation output using both automatic and human metrics. We find that, perhaps counter-intuitively, Machine Translation performs better on code-switching input than monolingual input. In particular, comparison of human and automatic evaluation suggests that codeswitching input may boost the semantic faithfulness of the translation output, an effect we term lexico-semantic enrichment. We also report two cases where this effect is most and least clear in Vietnamese–English, namely gender-neutral 3SG pronouns and interrogative constructions respectively. Overall, we suggest that Machine Translation, and Natural Language Processing more generally, ought to view multilingualism as an opportunity rather than an obstacle.Abbreviations: 1: First person; 2: Second person; 3: Third person; CLF: Classifier; COP: Copula; DET: Determiner; PL: Plural; POSS: Possessive marker; PRT: Particle; PST: Past tense; Q: Question marker; SG: Singular ",International Journal of Multilingualism

The study explored the motivations and emotions of 389 Filipino learners of LOTEs who accomplished a 76-item questionnaire. Six factors of LOTE motivation and two factors of LOTE emotions were simultaneously analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). Composite reliability measures showed that these factors were valid and reliable. Six sets of model fit measures indicated a good fit for the final SEM model. Initial and final direct effects showed that the six factors of LOTE motivation significantly influenced LOTE enjoyment and LOTE anxiety. Against the backdrop of studies dominated by the Japanese and Chinese experiences, the Filipino experience has shown to be equally susceptible to the influences of globalisation and the hegemony of English on learning languages other than English. The final SEM model of LOTE learning among Filipinos is instructive of the multifaceted LOTE motivation, but it also captures the effects of motivational constructs in the ‘flowering of emotions’ in the context of learners acquiring a language other than English.

In 2020, this building, housing the Department of Education, opened at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, in the city of Tromsø. Designing, constructing, and decorating a new building for a national teacher education was taken as an opportunity to reflect on and negotiate the institution’s role in relevant contemporary, as well as historical, educational discourses and to mark a current standpoint. Taking a nexus analytical approach, we analyse how linguistic and cultural diversity are represented in the department’s public space and how this is interwoven with the construction of the institution’s position in a multilingual and multicultural environment. Our analysis shows that this diversity is constructed through various contrasts. Sámi identities and regional roots of knowledge are emphasised in the official part of the semiotic landscape – framed as learnings from diversity. However, by analysing meta-sociolinguistic discourses about diversity, we show that this is accompanied by the erasure of other aspects of linguistic and cultural diversity, in particular Kven culture and identity, transnational diversity, and children and their lifeworld.

Most of the EL islands are fixed expressions and the multiword are collocated with each other. In most cases, EL islands are used as their counterparts in the Pashto language and lack the same pragmatic force.

This paper seeks to examine the spread, stability, and possible patterns of sociolinguistically-conditioned variation involving this system in the Lánnang-uè-speaking community. I conducted an acceptability judgment experiment involving 65 users in Manila and found high rates of spread and stability within my sample. Factors such as age, sex, and attitudes towards mixing selectively conditioned how some speakers adhered to system. For example, older users tended not to follow the affix source language, length, and position condition of the system whereas male users only tended not to follow the first condition. Based on the findings, I argue that the derivational affixation system exhibits conventionalisation, and that it emerged due to identity negotiation practices led by younger and female users. I also argue that conscious positive attitudes towards mixing help shape the stable development of multilingual practices. ",International Journal of Multilingualism

Examination of his trajectories in these domains sheds light on how the native-speakerism ideology prevailing in Korea had influenced the non-native English-speaking teacher’s identity development and was affecting his life as a language learner, a language teacher, and a parent. Three of his identities emerged from this study: a language learner who was struggling to join the community of native English speakers, a language teacher who was seeking students’ validation of his qualifications as a good English teacher, and a parent who expected his children to achieve his long-sought but seemingly unattainable goal of having native-like English proficiency. However, these identities were neither passively stable nor fixed, but rather were being constantly and actively negotiated. The findings suggest the necessity of taking a critical perspective on definitions of native speakers, on the impact of native-speakerism on the professional identity construction of non-native English-speaking teachers in EFL contexts, and on its effects on their domestic and social lives.

Nevertheless, educators seem rarely to draw on multiple languages in literacy activities. Furthermore, situations where educators and parents jointly read to children are scarce. Luxembourg, which has implemented a programme of multilingual education in ECEC, is an ideal context to investigate literacy practices and language use of educators and parents. Drawing on observations in two multilingual centres in Luxembourg as well as interviews, the present study examines the interactions between the educators and the 3-year-old children and those between the educators, parents, and children when the parents occasionally read books in the centres. The findings show that the educators in both centres used several languages and that the types of interactions differed. When the parents offered literacy activities, their use of languages and the roles they played also differed, varying from being fully involved to taking a marginal role. The findings can help educators and policymakers develop inclusive and participatory literacy practices which actively involve children and parents. ",International Journal of Multilingualism

Learners’ production of 17 onset and 21 coda German consonant clusters were auditorily analysed with respect to accuracy and error type. Findings showed that L3 pronunciation accuracy was affected by the similarities between each individual L3 consonant cluster and its possible correspondences in L1 Cantonese and L2 English. An L3 German consonant cluster that contained more Cantonese and English consonants would be produced more accurately, whereas an L3 consonant cluster that looked similar to English but mismatched with English orthography would generate production errors (e.g. kn [kn] → kn [n]). Individual variation between different L3 consonant clusters suggests that cross-linguistic influences on the L3 can occur from both the L1 and the L2 at the feature level and can be both positive and negative. At the same time, the study also shows that L3 speech is significantly influenced by markedness and language experience factors. ",International Journal of Multilingualism

One main point of contact of families and discourses on language is the education system. Previous research has shown that bilingual families orient towards teachers for advice on their language policies and tend to adopt the schools’ view on languages. This especially applies to families, in which three or more languages are spoken. In this article, I will present the results from a case study with two highly multilingual families in Germany and the parents’ orientation to the education system. Findings show that in the case of the two families, teachers do not have extensive direct influence. Instead, the main impact that the education system has on the families’ language policy is indirect by conveying and enforcing mainstream language ideologies and supporting high prestige languages such as English and French, while the parents constantly try to anticipate potential expectations by stakeholders in the education system.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Liu; Dieuwerke Rutgers,"Language experiences, evaluations and emotions (3Es): analysis of structural models of multilingual identity for language learners in schools in England",2022,"Researchers have traditionally relied on institutionally-defined, native speaker conceptions of linguistic competence to define whether or not individual learners are multilingual. However, to better understand the relationship between language and identity in the context of additional language learning, there is a need to widen the definition of multilingualism by including a larger repertoire of semiotic competences and a wider range of levels of linguistic competence. To date, little systematic research has investigated the relationship between different key variables influencing language learners’ construction of their multilingual identity (MI). Based on surveys completed by 1338 learners in seven secondary schools in England, this paper reports on a structural equation modelling of key latent variables influencing MI. The analysis suggests that MI is more strongly correlated with direct experiential contact with languages and with social interaction than with explicit beliefs about language learning. Similarly, the influence of parental beliefs is greater than those of teachers or friends. The paper also considers the significance of potential differences between EAL and non-EAL respondents and urban and rural school contexts. Having conducted SEM we offer support for our theorisation of MI as an outcome latent variable composed of three main components, namely, experience, evaluation and emotion.

As an important part of the Chinese language, spoken dialects, or ‘方言’ (fangyan), are highly complex in their classification and colloquial usage. Nevertheless, Chinese online users, especially those of younger generations, find ways to incorporate dialects in stylised online expressions for language play. This study explores the strategic adoptions of dialects by investigating stylised dialectal expressions through a leading video-sharing website in China, bilibili.com. By identifying representative Chinese dialectal phrases and phonetic features, the authors coded a total of 1779 instances of dialect-stylised expressions from 159 videos on bilibili.com. Further investigation and analysis reveal that the sampled expressions largely reflect the dialectal features found in Northeastern Guanhua, Cantonese, Southwestern Guanhua and Min, representing an overarching representation of some of the large dialectal groups in Chinese Mainland. In addition, various linguistic strategies, such as phonetic transliteration and Romanised letters, were used to facilitate and stylise the digital representations of these spoken dialects. The findings exhibit Bilibili users’ flexible choices of multilingual resources for dialect stylisation. ",International Journal of Multilingualism

The first aim of this article is to offer an overview of the two main current proposals of translanguaging together: García and colleagues’ ‘spontaneous translanguaging’ and Cenoz and Gorter’s ‘pedagogical translanguaging’. ‘Spontaneous translanguaging’ argues that languages in the mind are represented as one single system and that the notion of transfer, consequently, must be rejected. This article argues that this view may not be practical because it makes it difficult for teachers to conceptualise what they are doing when raising awareness of similarities between learners’ languages. ‘Pedagogical translanguaging’, by contrast, centres around transfer. Whereas transfer is traditionally seen as unintentional ‘interference’, pedagogical translanguaging considers it a phenomenon that learners can use intentionally and creatively, and which teachers could promote by raising learners’ awareness of similarities between their languages. However, very little is known about how learners use transfer unintentionally versus intentionally. This article discusses key findings and implications from Fuster’s (2022) initial study on intentionality in lexical transfer within pedagogical translanguaging.

Therefore, this qualitative study sought to understand the motivation and ultimate vision of a group of internally displaced Syrians learning Turkish as an L3 or L4 in Afrin on the Syrian-Turkish border. The data were collected from the participants’ written narratives and two subsequent rounds of individual online semi-structured interviews. The data suggest that the participants’ desire to learn Turkish ranged from the need to secure a job in Afrin to reasons associated with achieving their ideal selves by imagining themselves working/studying at a Turkish university and being integrated into the Turkish community in future. The participants were proactive agents, recognising that attending Turkish private tutoring courses with under-qualified tutors was not sufficient to improve their language proficiency. They capitalised on the availability of technology-mediated learning artefacts and the support of some informal actors. This qualitative study has pedagogical implications and provides further evidence of the need for SLA research to serve all multilingual people, not just the privileged, by conducing empirical studies in non-affluent geographies.

Our study contributes to this research by analyzing Spanish and German as HL or majority languages (MaL) and the children’s (receptive) linguistic competence from 86 multilingual children recruited in Germany and Spain (mean age 57.5 months). With the aid of a linguistic background questionnaire, Family Language Policies (FLP), presence/absence of HL in the family, institution and community for 50 of these children were examined. Our study shows that, in early multilingual acquisition, Spanish and German are acquired similarly when enjoying community support, on the one hand, or when being acquired as heritage languages, on the one hand. In these early years, the chosen FLP seems to have an impact on HL-competence, yet up to age 5;0. Other factors, such as the presence of the HL in the institution, act as useful pillars for promoting HL-competence, yet its presence in the family becomes decisive.",International Journal of Multilingualism

This study was motivated by a desire to better understand the language resources of students newly arrived as refugees in Australia and their embodied and contextualised experiences of their languages. Language portraits are a tool used to generate insights into language experiences. For this study, the language portrait tool was extended beyond the body to include contexts within which languages are experienced (school, home, the digital domain, other). Participants were 41 secondary students, who arrived as refugees from South Asia and the Middle East and were either enrolled in, or recent graduates of, an intensive English language programme. Findings were derived from (1) coding of languages according to embodied experience and context and (2) thematic analysis of students’ transcribed discussion. Patterns across the cohort indicated that these students primarily experience their thinking as monolingual in their L1. However, the coding of sensory zones indicates that multilingualism is experienced as a multisensory flow of viewing, listening, speaking, eating and otherwise experiencing. Challenging assumptions of the home language environments of refugee students, homes appeared as multilingual domains. ",International Journal of Multilingualism

The study is part of a larger action research project aiming at developing new ways of teaching and learning in culturally and linguistically diverse classrooms. The math teachers hypothesised that their students would be able to benefit more from math instruction if they were able to draw on their full linguistic repertoire in class. As a response to this, a series of teaching activities addressing mathematical discourse in Danish, Arabic, and the other languages present in the classrooms were developed and delivered to the two classes. A group of Arabic-speaking students worked with math assignments and mathematical discourse using learning materials in both Danish and Arabic, but other languages present in the linguistically heterogenetic classes were also involved in the teaching and learning activities, integrating translanguaging practices in math teaching activities. Findings indicate that translanguaging practices in the math classroom have the potentials to elicit linguistic awareness about the nature of mathematical discourse in students, but also raise awareness about the role of languages in the classroom as such.

As teachers have a central role in implementing language policies, their practices either support or impede learning as well as learners’ multilingual identities. Multilingual practices entailing rich scaffolding and translanguaging strategies are supposed to be beneficial for content and language learning and the learners’ identity development. The methodological approach adopted in this study is ethnographic, and the theoretical framework is linguistically responsive teaching and multilingual education. The data consist of teacher interviews and focus group discussions, a questionnaire and classroom observations. The analysis method is qualitative content analysis. The data were collected in two Namibian government primary schools in the beginning of the 2020 school year. The analysis shows that translanguaging strategies such as peer translation or explaining concepts in home languages are used, but rarely as pre-planned pedagogical strategies. Scaffolding is provided mostly through visual aids. It may be concluded that the translanguaging strategies already in use should be encouraged further, and multilingual pedagogies should be included in both pre-service and in-service teacher education.

Participants are from three families originating in waves of German-speaking migrants to Australia between the 1930s and 1970s. We find that FLP only occasionally maps onto the stages of shifting ideology, highlighting individual agency of families in setting their own FLP, although sometimes remnants of bygone ideologies enter the family through marriage. Furthermore, while participants negotiated inconsistent impacts of education policies on the availability of German classes at school, to support their FLP, they utilise forms of language education outside the school system, including travel to the German-speaking ‘homelands’. These case studies underline the individuality of participants’ experiences of FLP, their autonomy, and success in shaping their own language policies.

Importantly, Spanish and French plosives are typically produced with short-lag VOT, whereas English plosives are produced with a long-lag VOT and aspiration. The results of generalised mixed-effects models revealed that L3 French productions by the bilingual group fell between L1 and L2 values, and provided evidence that the bilingual group experienced influence from both their L1, Spanish and their L2, English, while the monolingual group produced the French as a Spanish-like short-lag. Additionally, a post-hoc analysis of individual differences revealed that a subset of participants experienced heavy L1 influence on their L3 productions, whereas the remaining participants showed a lower, but considerable, degree of L2 influence on L3 productions.

Drawing on what we call a Second Wave of Southern Perspectives (SWaSP), that sees the entanglements of two clusters – the first of which comprises contemporary ways of reading anticolonial, postcolonial and decolonial thinkers with offerings of Southern perspectives, and a second where contemporary theories about language and communication that considers their cultural and social dimensions, this paper calls for a mobile global-centric gazing. More specifically this paper actualises ontoepistemological trajectories that feed into the scholarship about multilingualism, looking at its different possible beings and becomings that enable a variety of ways of conceptualising multilingual practices. We do this by first presenting a brief review about recent discussions related to the concept of repertoires in the field of multilingualism and pathways that can move these debates in different directions. After this, we present possible ways to go beyond the sociolinguistics of multilingualism, by considering contemporary challenges in the knowledge production enterprise.",International Journal of Multilingualism

As previous theorisation suggests that semiotic repertoires are deployed by agentive individuals, this article draws from New Materialism to focus on how social agents, semiotic repertoires, and material ecologies work together in distributed practice for meaning making. Expanding sociolinguistic constructs for this purpose, the article defines the relevant units and objects of analysis, and illustrates the framing of activities in indexing the values, meanings, and relationships of semiotic repertoires. The role of these repertoires in the interaction of an international community of scientists is analysed through the research group meeting of a team of microbiologists. The article demonstrates that though the focal participant from Korea claims limited English grammatical proficiency in his personal repertoire, he draws strategically from the repertoires in the physical setting and those of his disciplinary community to communicate successfully.",International Journal of Multilingualism

We further theorise the relationship between cosmopolitanism and translingual practice with our focus on morality in relation to the use of the semiotic repertoire. The use of resources of the semiotic repertoire in translingual practice is infused with morality in that resources (such as languages, individual signs, mouthing, fingerspelling alphabets) are value laden and have particular associations or meanings in a given context. We explore and define deaf cosmopolitanism by offering examples from three international settings: deaf tourism in Bali, a sign language conference in Brazil, and a Bible translation centre in Kenya. Deaf people engaging in international mobilities align in communication by what they call ‘calibrating’. In this process, mobile deaf people quickly adopt new semiotic resources by engaging in rapid, immersive and informal (sign) language learning, acquiring (bits of) new sign languages, mouthing, written words, and fingerspelling alphabets, and including them in their practice of calibrating. Our analysis centres language ideologies about these practices, demonstrating moral ideas about what strategies and semiotic resources are most appropriate in specific contexts and/or with/by whom.",International Journal of Multilingualism

What is often underestimated in both approaches is the importance of the bodily and emotionally lived experience of communicative interaction. This experience, however, can be critical in preventing resources from being deployed even though they are individually available and appropriate to the situation as well as in mobilising unexpected resources to achieve understanding. Conceiving the repertoire as holding an intermediate and mediating position between situated interactions, (sometimes competing) discourses, and subjects’ lived experiences of communicating, in this paper, I examine the interplay of these instances by introducing the notion of the ‘body image’: an imaginary, affectively loaded representation of the own body in relation to others. Finally, I discuss the language portrait (in which participants visualise their semiotic resources with reference to the outline of a body silhouette) as a window onto the body image and as a method to empirically investigate how people evaluate their resources and position themselves with regard to ideologies of communication.",International Journal of Multilingualism

In this qualitative study, we examined the reading practices of multilingual learners and one teacher in isiZulu and English in a Grade 3 classroom in an urban township primary school in South Africa. We adopted translanguaging as a theoretical lens through which we studied the reading events in the two languages. Data collection included classroom observations, audio recording of lessons, and semi-structured interviews with the teacher and the learners. Findings show that through translanguaging, the teacher and the learners were able to tap into a range of their communicative and linguistic resources and also drew on their social and cultural worlds to make sense of the texts. In addition, we found that despite this, there were constant conflicts and tensions between the teacher’s discourses and actual practices.

In this paper we make a case for a conceptual framework that defines multilingual identity formation in terms of learners’ active involvement, and proposes the classroom as the hitherto underused site for participative identity (re)negotiation. After reviewing three key theoretical perspectives on identity (the psychosocial, sociocultural and poststructural) for points of intersection and difference, we propose a new framework for a multi-theoretical approach to the conceptualisation and investigation of multilingual identity. This places it at the nexus of (a) individual psychological development, (b), the relational and social, and (c) the historical and contextual. Arguing that a participative perspective can take the field forward, we present a theorised model for classroom practice that provides a structure within which individual learners of a foreign language might explore, with reference to a range of sociolinguistic knowledge, the extent of their current linguistic repertoire. In addition, they are asked to explicitly consider their identity and identifications and offered the agency to (re)negotiate these in terms of multilingual identity, the development of which may be important for investment in language learning.",International Journal of Multilingualism

He does not go into detail about the depth with which mother tongues are acquired in the different multilingual family configurations. Thus, after his concluding accounts of code-switching and diglossia, a gap remains between his description of language acquisition and his accounts of literary phenomena related to multilingualism. Here the reader can clearly see that his approach is linguistic rather than philological. Another point of critique concerns the shortage of theoretical analysis. In its place, the reader finds numerous examples, which, while they indeed help illustrate Maher’s points and make for a colorful and hands-on account of the many facets of multilingualism, are not an adequate substitute for critical analysis and interpretation (cf. 4–5). On the other hand, this may at the same time constitute one of the strengths of Maher’s work, which never runs the risk of dealing with languages as dry and dead matter. Without bias or tendentiousness, Maher nonetheless succeeds in drawing attention to the field of multilingualism, while saving several important topics from oblivion and thereby counteracting and preempting simplifying presentist tendencies in this politically and societally charged, yet somewhat neglected, field of research. That he succeeds in condensing the subject’s staggering depth and complexity into a short and coherent narrative may be the book’s greatest achievement. Other notable strengths are its sustained and careful attention to the relation between multilingualism and society, appreciation of the varied terminology that has shaped the field, and the author’s insightful discussion of Asian languages (cf. 8; 13). The meticulously edited volume contains a list of illustrations, a short bibliography, references, a section on further reading that includes numerous websites as guides for further research, and an index (133–48).

English seems to be the dominant language when taking into consideration the bilingual education policy, numerous campaigns promoting its use in terms of spoken language, and language use by the media. Another mechanism that also contributes to the predominance of English over the other three official languages is linguistic landscape, i.e. language use in public space. Adopting the ecology of language as its conceptual framework and linguistic landscape as its methodological tool, this article, by analyzing public signs in and around 30 MRT (Mass Rapid Transport) stations of the Circle Line (CCL), discloses not only English imperialism but also the complexity of this language in Singapore with its dual identity as a global language as well as a local one.

In particular, collecting data from the mobile photo-sharing platform Instagram permits the analysis of the authorial control exerted by the Original Poster (OP) over their discursive practices from two distinct perspectives. One line of enquiry is the examination of preferred readings of the images by the OP, which is either affirmed or contested by the poster’s friends, followers, and others, with the view to assessing trends in language practices amongst users. A second vector is the (re)creative approach, where the OP often uses expensive branded goods in the image in a ludic way to convey a sense of their identity. To this end, we discuss how individuals draw on visual resources to hand to present themselves to others. Based on a corpus of images uploaded and geotagged at Orly airport, we explore here the approaches to self-representation on social media in order to typologize the resources – including languages – that twenty-first-century French nationals draw upon to create their individual but simultaneously collective identity.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Using the geosemiotic framework as a heuristic guide, we analyze how the spectacle of Chinatown is constituted through spatial, linguistic, semiotic, and material resources, and find that the unordinariness of the place is contingent on and emerges through its juxtaposition with ordinary space, practice, and language use. We suggest this apparent paradox can be understood through the process of scaling, during which signs and practices that might have been considered quotidian become monumentalised and ritualised when they are transported across timescales and spatial scales. Incheon's Chinatown then affords an opportunity to understand the semiotic and material production of ‘unordinariness’ through ‘ordinariness’.

Following in the spirit of linguistic landscape analysis, we investigate one particular dimension of the visual semiosis of this shop, namely the signage. Drawing upon photographic and interview data, we trace the history of this semiosis, charting how its purpose and meaning has changed over time. What emerges from our study is that what seems idiosyncratic to researchers can have rich local meaning in context. What appears to be an outlier on the linguistic landscape can offer insight into situated experiences. In this light, our study of a shop and its semiotic landscape contributes to an understanding of the changing sociolinguistic patterns and creativity that occur in spaces like Singapore, and that reflect not just contemporary but also previous eras of globalisation and contact across historical, political and cultural borders.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Originally, the researchers intended to study how English-Filipino translanguaging, the use of linguistic features of different languages to achieve meaning-making, (1) supports development of academic writing skills in Filipino for heritage learners who have undergone subtractive bilingualism and (2) challenges the ideology of discrete languages and speech communities. However, throughout the term, students’ translanguaging practices did not necessarily improve their writing skills in Filipino, and interviews revealed that they still saw themselves as having varied proficiency in English, Filipino (Tagalog-based), and other Filipino languages, which they linked to particular speech communities. Nevertheless, students participated actively and felt they were learning, and translanguaging led to understanding of deeper and more critical content. From these findings, we propose a translanguaging pedagogy that recognises the different social realms in which students have various opportunities to develop different parts of their linguistic repertoires, rather than a pedagogy that simply strives to dissolve linguistic barriers to promote bilingualism and biliteracy.",International Journal of Multilingualism

This study explores the transfer of these variable sociolinguistic patterns at the initial stages of third language acquisition. We elicited narratives in Portuguese from two mirror-image groups of sequential Spanish-English bilingual early learners of Portuguese. Their production of variable subject pronoun expression was analysed. When comparing the two groups with regards to the linguistic factors that constrain subject pronoun expression, evidence of transfer from Spanish and not from English is consistent for both groups. We conclude that variable linguistic information is accessible in L3 transfer at beginning stages of acquisition and it is successfully predicted by holistic models of L3 acquisition.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Trilingualism multiplies this challenge. To investigate how third language (L3) learners manage interference between languages, Spanish-English bilinguals were taught an artificial language that conflicted with English and Spanish letter-sound mappings. Interference from existing languages was higher for L3 words that were similar to L1 or L2 words, but this interference decreased over time. After mastering the L3, learners continued to experience competition from their other languages. Notably, spoken L3 words activated orthography in all three languages, causing participants to experience cross-linguistic orthographic competition in the absence of phonological overlap. Results indicate that L3 learners are able to control between-language interference from the L1 and L2. We conclude that while the transition from two languages to three presents additional challenges, bilinguals are able to successfully manage competition between languages in this new context.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Plurilingualism can be understood as the study of individuals’ repertoires and agency in several languages, in different contexts, in which the individual is the locus and actor of contact; accordingly, a person’s languages and cultures interrelate and change over time, depending on individual biographies, social trajectories, and life paths. The term ‘plurilingual competence’ adds emphasis on learners’ agency, and constraints and opportunities in educational contexts. We discuss where and how plurilingualism fits among the other lingualisms, its similarities and differences, with an example of plurilingual pedagogy and practice from a university in Vancouver, Canada.

Finally, we compare the results of the two data sets to the traditional genealogic characterisation of the three language groups.

Affordance theory with its focus on the individual, the environment and the emergent character of language learning opportunities is particularly well-suited for dealing with the complexity of individual and societal multilingualism. As affordances are located between past experience and potential future action affordance theory takes prior learning experiences, future learning opportunities as well as situational motivational factors into account.",International Journal of Multilingualism

In the current study, we examined how mothers and fathers of mixed-language families linguistically identified themselves and others, and how ideological discourses and concepts historically and socially situated in Finland circulated through the parents’ talk. The parents of three families in which at least Finnish, Swedish and English were used on a daily basis were interviewed. A discourse nexus approach showed that the concept of ‘mother tongue(s)’ played a central role and that although all family members were in practice multilingual, there was a strong tendency across the couples to identify themselves and others as monolingual. Bilingualism was identified with Finnish-Swedish rather than other languages and a native discourse expressed bilingual identity as granted by birth rather than acquired later. The discourses could be traced back to official language registration procedures, the educational system in Finland, as well as to parents’ own lived experiences. The study illustrates the intricate relationships between language ideologies and how linguistic identities are created and performed among parents, and it pinpoints the need for further studies on how linguistic identities are passed on to and experienced by children along their life trajectories.",International Journal of Multilingualism

The case study revolves around two young male children born to adolescent mothers living in socio-economically marginalised neighbourhoods in Cape Town, South Africa. Whilst family language policy research has traditionally investigated children's language learning in multilingual family contexts, this paper focuses on practices and discourses around swearing. The children are raised in a particular type of family: their young parents do not live together, but with their respective extended families. Drawing on recordings of interactions and casual conversations, the paper shows that swearing is an important topic for adults within talk around children's language. General questions around family language policy uncover the participants’ association of children's use of Afrikaans with swearing. Moreover, the interpretation of empirical data brings to the fore the contradictions between language socialisation practices and expressed family language policies around children's acquisition of swearwords. Furthermore, the paper highlights how beliefs around children and swearing are not expressed within the nuclear family as a social unit, but rather along extended family lines – thereby emphasising the processes of ‘family making’.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Through a 6-month multi-site ethnography of three case-study informants which included recorded interviews and spontaneous interactions, I explore how migrants engage with various pluralisations of local and global English in reported encounters with other migrants and local residents, and I show that they share ambivalent positionings towards them. They generally present themselves as speaking ‘small’ or ‘no’ English, in acts of linguistic delegitimisation whereby they inhabit marginalised, de-skilled pan-African identities. However, on other occasions, they position themselves as ‘better’ English speakers than local populations who sanction ‘outer-circle’ English forms, in acts of self-legitimisation whereby they vindicate their ‘native speakerhood’ condition, constitutive of educated, cosmopolitan identities revolving around ‘Ghanaianness’. I conclude that these sociolinguistic comportments speak of migrants’ linguistic marginalisation. They uncover ways in which situated forms of identity categorisation linked to the censorship of socioeconomically-stratified English varieties shape, and are shaped by, hegemonic monolingual ideologies and societal normativities concerning ‘English standardness’ which dictate who count as legitimate transnational citizens in the Southern European societies of the twenty-first century.",International Journal of Multilingualism

We discuss key assumptions and analytical developments that have shaped the sociolinguistic study of signed and spoken language multilingualism as separate from different strands of multimodality studies. In most multimodality studies, researchers focus on participants using one named spoken language within broader embodied human action. Thus while attending to multimodal communication, they do not attend to multilingual communication. In translanguaging studies the opposite has happened: scholars have attended to multilingual communication without really paying attention to multimodality and simultaneity, and hierarchies within the simultaneous combination of resources. The (socio)linguistics of sign language has paid attention to multimodality but only very recently have started to focus on multilingual contexts where multiple sign and/or multiple spoken languages are used. There is currently little transaction between these areas of research. We argue that the lens of semiotic repertoires enables synergies to be identified and provides a holistic focus on action that is both multilingual and multimodal.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Whilst French law recognizes the country's RLs in terms of national heritage, the official supremacy of French remains constitutionally unchallenged. This means that, along with other public texts, street names are only officially sanctioned in French. The bilingual street signs in central Toulouse recognize this hegemony by consistently displaying French above Occitan. However, they also suggest a covert preference for the RL, where Occitan overshadows French in the meaning associations of street names, and their translation and adaptation on the lower plaques. This challenges the linguistic hierarchy as determined by code preference, as Occitan emerges as a dominant code hidden in plain sight. This article proposes several methods for quantifying Occitan vitality as seen on street signs.

In a community such as Catalonia wherein two languages of different status are in conflict within its own territory, the ability of families to maintain a socially ‘weaker’ language and transmit yet another language that does not have an official status within the community raises an important question: how do these cross-linguistic families cope with a ‘double minority context’ in terms of organising their language use within the family? Analysing the data collected through a questionnaire survey conducted with 29 Japanese–Catalan/Spanish-speaking families living in Catalonia revealed that the parents in said families adopted a mostly monolingual use of Spanish; however, this practice does not affect the families’ Catalan and Japanese use. Not establishing a single common language for the family may be one of the strategies to combat the threat to minority languages. In general, especially for the survey participants, Catalan and Japanese remain significantly utilised. Our study also found that sibling existence can influence language-use patterns between parent and child(ren), with monolingual practices tending to be used in single-child families.",International Journal of Multilingualism

This study reveals that CHLLs obtain a lower level of Chinese language proficiency despite their cultural background and language advantages. Scholars have tended to analyse CHLLs’ academic performance through linguistic or cultural perspectives. Drawing on research studies of tracking systems, this study compares the dual-track system in a Chinese language programme with the tracking system in place at American K-12 schools. This comparison allows for a deeper understanding of how CHLLs’ status as a minority in American language classrooms makes it more difficult for CHLLs to learn Chinese. This study examines the cultural processes and structural forces that shape the learning environment of CHLLs.

However, it is unclear whether efforts to support students' first language development, particularly for large populations of students whose primary language is not the dominant language, is sufficient for ‘levelling the playing field’ in terms of academic achievement. We analysed subsets of data from the 2011 Progress in International Reading Literacy Study and the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment to investigate the by-country effects of officially recognised languages on reading performance. Participants represent countries with only two official languages (e.g. Canada, Israel) and primarily used one of these languages at home. Preliminary findings from hierarchical linear modelling show that the dominant official language predicts reading performance unless the minority language reflects a language internationally valued and revered by local stake holders (e.g. English in the United Arab Emirates). Implications suggest that educational resources and programmes should be sensitive to the historical context of country-specific language ideologies and related stereotypical perceptions that favour the dominant language within the school context.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Statistical analyses revealed small but significant positive correlations between the three multilingualism measures used and LLLOC scores, with higher scores indicating a more internal LLLOC. Participants with a higher linguistic repertoire size and overall language proficiency, who used their languages more frequently, had higher LLLOC scores than those with less languages at lower levels of proficiency and frequency of use.

Therefore, this study aims to depict the distribution of MLA between different linguistic groups in a Danish school context and to determine whether there is a correlation between MLA and academic achievement. Additionally, the relationship between socioeconomic status and test results is investigated. Participants are categorised according to the languages they report using actively. 219 pupils aged 14–16, 106 monolingual and 113 bi-/multilingual, completed a questionnaire and a test of MLA, both in Danish. School leaving exam results and a measure of socioeconomic status were also obtained.

Surprisingly, little is known about the creation of these signs and the decision-making behind their creation. This linguistic landscape is analysed using nexus analysis which sheds light on the convergence of (1) the historical body of social actors in which teachers are primarily responsible for sign making, (2) an interaction order in which teachers practise organic sign placement and (3) discourses in place which include the promotion of bilingualism.

In addition to photographs, interviews with business owners have been conducted and used for triangulation purposes. The data suggest that multidimensionality marks the linguistic landscape of the city. The multidimensionality is embedded in the complex sociopolitical, economic and ethnolinguistic facets and trends the linguistic landscape demonstrates. The sociopolitical dimension signifies the officially laid-down monolingual Malay-oriented policies, which accentuate compulsory use of the national language Malay. Non-compliance to the official version of policy results in strict punitive actions. The economic dimension manifests in the prominent use of English for its advertising and symbolic potential. Similarly, the ethnolinguistic dimension denotes vitality and identity expressed by the Chinese and Indian communities in specific localities. The study argues that although the official policy is formulated and implemented with the intent of unifying a multiethnic population, discursive defiance to this policy at the bottom levels can be triggered by many reasons including pragmatism, religion or identity, and such defiance clearly transpires in the linguistic and semiotic representation of the signboards.",International Journal of Multilingualism

It is assumed that these bilinguals already have an L1-governed pragmatic competence at place, which will be adjusted to accommodate the socio-cultural requirements of the new language. So there is no separate L2 pragmatic competence. What happens is that the existing L1-governed pragmatic competence becomes bilingual pragmatic competence while changing dynamically under the influence of the new language and its socio-cultural requirements and behaviour patterns blending the emerging features and skills with the existing ones. I will argue that there is a basic difference between the development of pragmatic competence in L1 and the sequential development of bilingual pragmatic competence.

The challenges of responding to a rapidly changing educational landscape to ensure that our learners become pluriliterate global citizens are presented through three case studies each set in a different multilingual context. These classroom-based studies into effective learning focus on teachers and learners as co-researchers and involve reflexive processes which engage teachers and learners in the analysis of their own practices. The findings emphasise the need to support ‘reciprocity’ and ‘pedagogic attention’ through shared learner and teacher awareness of learning as well as to provide methods for instructing learners in metacognitive strategy use. The authors conclude that bilingual educational contexts provide potentially rich learning environments which – if they are to realise this potential – will demand new way...,International Journal of Multilingualism

The government's implementation of an official policy has led to the deconstruction and reshaping of the Druze political and national identity to one that differs substantially from that of the Palestinian minority in Israel. In this study, I argue that the visibility, vitality and appreciation of Hebrew in the Druze linguistic landscape are indicative of new ethnolinguistic boundaries of the Druze identity in Israel. The fact that the Druze in Israel are dispersed throughout the Galilee and Mount Carmel area and experience varying levels of language contact as well as divergent economic relations with their Palestinian–Israeli and Jewish–Israeli neighbours, suggests that one cannot expect uniformity in the Druze linguistic markets or the processes of social, cultural and linguistic identification.

The contemporary struggle between national and multicultural identities is considered against the background of the re-emergence of nationalist discourses across many Western democracies as a consequence of changing global social and economic forces. This is the new age of ‘liquid’ modernity, as theorised by Bauman, a kind of chaotic continuation of ‘solid’ modernity where risk and uncertainty accentuate the vulnerability of the individual rather than uniting individuals to defend their rights. During this time, Australian governments, both Liberal and Labor, have increasingly supported universalising social inclusion/social cohesion policies to the detriment of multicultural policies. In the concluding section, this paper reflects on current trends and future challenges and provides a perspective on what may be required for a successful pr...",International Journal of Multilingualism

The current study investigates the pragmatic differentiation of a child who lives in Australia and was acquiring two minority languages, German and Japanese, from his parents (German father; Japanese mother) who were following the one-parent, one-language principle. A maternal diary was kept from when the child was born, and the child's interactions with each parent were video-taped from 1;4 to 1;9. It was found that the child used two languages in a differentiated manner throughout the observed period. Several factors such as child's lexicon, habitual language use, parental discourse style and language dynamics surrounding child were investigated and all were found to affect the child's language choice. The child's early pragmatic differentiation provides support for the view of two-system hypothesis.",International Journal of Multilingualism

The differences of two groups of students were analysed by taking into account the answers provided in two similar questionnaires, one in 2004 and the other in 2012. The results obtained confirm that the incipient trilingual identity detected in 2004 has increased significantly though its current level is not very high yet. Due to the institutional efforts made so far, the fruits of a long-term linguistic policy are reaching the University of the Basque Country. A more overall successful performance in the three languages (Basque/Spanish/English) and a more favourable attitude towards English have led to a higher trilingual identity. However, English is not clearly associated with a cultural reference (integrative motivation) but with a necessary language (instrumental motivation). The Basque language seems to be fighting well for its survival in the presence of co-official Spanish and all-powerful English.",International Journal of Multilingualism

While she gives an outline of the results of her studies 1 3 in Chapter V, she ingeniously holds it back in her studies 4 and 5. Undeniably, the book has two recognisable merits: first, while recognising the complexity of research on multilingual mental lexicons, the book offers an exhaustive study of related research, completes a summary of the studies done from 1981 to 2003 (p. 53) and provides a framework a multilingual storage, processing and retrieval within which the actions of learning and relearning (or unlearning) lexicons may be organised. Second, it identifies the major variables determining the structure and ways of access and retrieval of a lexical item in a particular language in a multilingual lexicon: learning environment (natural versus classroom setting), functional competence (language dominance), language proficiency in each language, learning transfer (influence of learning strategies), linguistic tasks, perceived and real typological distance between languages (p. 51). This lends support to future research on multilingual mental lexicon with relevance to teaching and/or facilitating foreign language learning to learners with rich learning experiences, that is, with extensive exposure to Information and Communication Technology (ICT). It is possible that the ICT tools which are available to teachers, learners and administrators may point to a direction of maximising the ICT-based learning environment by constructing a scholastic structure where the aforementioned variables may be observed, assessed and further scrutinised.

Heretofore, the material culture of multilingualism has remained largely unresearched. This is surprising, since the environment of multilinguals is replete with material artefacts and objects (including technologically-enabled materialities) that represent their past and present real-life realities and which both reflect and influence languages and change language-related practices. Complementing present approaches to understanding the ecology of the multilingual environment in linguistic landscape research, this theoretical paper demonstrates that a study of materiality as a representation of its users is of considerable benefit to research approaches to multilingualism.",International Journal of Multilingualism

The classic Stroop effect was detected in all three languages, with participants performing more accurately on congruent than on incongruent trials. Multilinguals were faster and more accurate in the within-language-competition condition than in the between-language-competition condition, indicating that additional processing costs are required when stimulus and response languages differ. Language proficiency influenced speed, accuracy and error patterns in multilingual Stroop task performance.

It was hypothesised that in London Greek-Cypriots, where CS is a ‘default mode’, pausing behaviour would be affected by the same factors as in monolinguals, but not by CS. In Cyprus, on the other hand, where CS serves specific discourse functions, overall fluency was expected to be negatively affected by the more marked character of the alternation. Results revealed that CS has no significant effect on pausing in either context.

The children live in Switzerland and have been exposed to English, French and Swiss German from infancy. The focus is on the children's production of these languages, and the contextual and affective factors which have influenced their levels of active trilingualism. The method consists of two longitudinal case studies. Monthly recordings were made by each caregiver (mother, father and third caregiver) in dyadic interactions with the children from ages 2;1 to 3;1. It was found that one child had a high level of active trilingualism, speaking the language of the caregiver with that caregiver over 90% of the time (measured in utterances). By contrast, the other child had a low level of active trilingualism. An analysis of the children's language exposure, such as the position of the community language in the home, the variety of exposure, the interactional style of the caregivers, and the prestige of the languages involved indicates the importance of motivation, largely influenced by the caregivers in interaction, in explaining the children's different levels of active trilingualism.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Instances of linguistic and cultural influence in the child's English which may be traced back to the language of the main provider of input are identified, giving insights into input-related processes and the way parental background may also influence the child's discourse skills in situations where input is limited to one parent in the home.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Data were collected at Japanese daycare centres for a trilingual German–English–Japanese boy from ages 1;1 to 1;10 and for a trilingual Chinese–English–Japanese girl from ages 2;0 to 2;4. Both children demonstrated discourse separation by using more than 90% Japanese in the daycare environment.

Metrolingualism gives us a way to move beyond current terms such as ‘multilingualism’ and ‘multiculturalism’. It is a product of modern and often urban interaction, describing the ways in which people of different and mixed backgrounds use, play with and negotiate identities through language. The focus is not so much on language systems as on languages as emergent from contexts of interaction. Looking at data from workplaces where metrolingual language use is common, we show how the use of both fixed and fluid linguistic and cultural identities is part of the process of language use. The notion of metrolingualism gives us ways of moving beyond common frameworks of language, providing insights into contemporary, urban language practices, and accommodating both fixity and fluidity in its approach to language use.",International Journal of Multilingualism

The results of acceptability judgement tests and preference tests show that the initial state of L3 English is influenced exclusively by the final state of L1 Arabic.

Our results show that especially the less advanced readers of German benefit from their English-reading competence. With increasing competence in German, the influence of English decreases. Furthermore, correlations between the German-reading test and students' overall foreign-language-reading competence hint at possible advantages of being multilingual.

The narratives show contradictory feelings towards the issue of multilinguality, which generally is experienced as a greater obstacle by multilingual adults who have predominantly gone to state schools than by adults who went to international schools. Education and different school systems play a role in constructing the cultural frameworks of inclusion and exclusion. This paper concludes that a significant factor for the differing perceptions may lie in the opportunity or lack thereof to share the experience of multiple allegiances and identifications with peers. In that respect, some school environments contribute to the cultivation of their students' linguistic and cultural awareness, and multilinguality is consequently no longer perceived as a personal or communal threat.",International Journal of Multilingualism

The chosen example of triple language contact is characterised by consecutive bilingualism as the basis of L3 acquisition, where the learners' L2 is typologically related to L3. It will be discussed whether extended competence in a Germanic language may constitute the basis for transfer in phonetic acquisition of a further Germanic language.

The investigation is embedded into a threefold framework: (1) considering the linguistic plurality of the European Union and its educational and linguistic policy, it examines the status of English as L3 in Europe; (2) according to the learners' psycholinguistic characteristics, it discusses the age issue in L3 phonetic acquisition; and (3) against the background of contrastive analysis, it illustrates differences and similarities between German, Italian and English phonetics, and phonology. Within this framework, infant bilinguals' German and Italian vowels will be phonetically analysed and compared with English target vowels.

The implications for L3 phonetic acquisition based on the findings are intended as a preliminary, small-scale investigation in preparation of a wider study on a longitudinal basis.

The word ‘new’ in the title seems to refer simultaneously to three things: (a) the fact that Spain’s return to democracy and its embracing of its multilingualism is still relatively fresh; (b) the new educational context in Spain regarding language support and instruction; and (c) the fact that the relatively recent influx of immigrants in Spain has created new kinds of bilingualism and multilingualism. Despite the expectations raised in the reader’s mind by this last meaning of ‘new’, however, most of the empirical focus of the book is on bilingualism and multilingualism involving combinations of languages that have long been indigenous to Spain Basque, Catalan, Galician and Spanish as well as on the learning of English by speakers of these languages. The book consists of an introduction and a prologue, followed by 12 chapters. In the introduction, the editors mention how developments in the fields of second language acquisition and multilingualism have coincided with new political, educational and demographic developments in Spain related to language learning and multilingualism. Within this context, a number of very active language acquisition research teams have been established in Spain, and this book is intended to provide a representative sample of the recent empirical focuses and findings of these teams. Twenty-one of the 24 authors of the book’s chapters are researchers at universities in Spain, and the three other authors (i.e. Juana Liceras, Rocı́o PérezTattam and Cristina Sanz) are also actively involved in research in Spain. The empirical studies are found in Chapters 2 12, but these are first contextualised by the prologue and an overview chapter. The prologue is written by Miquel Siguan, who provides a historical and contemporary description of the languages of Spain, where they are spoken, what policies are in place concerning their use and support, what languages are taught in Spain, and what the research so far has shown about the advantages versus disadvantages of bilingualism and bilingual education in Spain. Chapter 1 is written by the three editors of the book, and it provides additional contextualisation by giving an overview of the terms, themes and issues that are dealt with throughout the book, including whether bilinguals’ languages are stored separately in the mind, in which contexts bilingual acquisition is most successful, the role of cross-linguistic influence in relation to other factors that can affect language acquisition and use, and the areas of language knowledge and use International Journal of Multilingualism Vol. 7, No. 2, May 2010, 184 195",International Journal of Multilingualism

Discussed are parts of the findings of an empirical study investigating the motivation of 12 Chinese students to study German as a major at a university in Hong Kong. The data collected for the duration of two academic semesters through interviews and diary entries indicated that language learning was seen as a practice through which students attempted to attain a certain kind of individuality. By drawing on Foucault's concept of ethical self-formation, an alternative theoretical framework was designed to analyse the students' reason for learning German, which were investigated under the four themes characteristic of Foucault's ethical self-formation: (a) what parts of the learners' selves are concerned with learning German? (b) what ethical values and beliefs do learners attach to their learning German? (c) how do learners apply German in their daily life? and (d) what are the le...",International Journal of Multilingualism

The strong local embedding of migrant communities within a specific urban setting, i.e. industrial cities (Roubaix, Tourcoing, Lille), as well as the strong integration policy of the target culture, explain how and why Flemish cultural items are transferred and undergo a process of formal and functional hybridisation with the available institutional, linguistic and discursive models of the target culture.

The research findings indicate that the mathematics teacher educators regard multilingualism and the language practices that come with it such as code-switching more as a problem rather than a resource for teaching and learning. Contrary to the emphasis that code-switching is spontaneous and encouraged in schools, it is found that the nature of code-switching in college mathematics classroom is not spontaneous; rather it is very much controlled and restricted.

These preschoolers were aged four and a half to six and a half. We observed how they treated the reception of information during situations of communication in which they did not share the same language as their interlocutor. We hypothesised that children with a LLE in a formal context would outperform children without that specific experience (nLLE) with respect to their communicative abilities in this test paradigm. Furthermore, we hypothesised that the differences observed might be due to the fact that LLE children would be more aware of contextual cues than nLLE children. As a result, the LLE children might be more inclined to answer the actor and less inclined to give up the exchange. Our results confirm that a formal learning context (LLE) significantly improves metacognitive awareness and that this is a relevant factor in facilitating the treatment of communicative interactions.",International Journal of Multilingualism

It argues that multilingualism is the ineluctable concomitant of all dimensions of globalisation and that the application in the relevant literature of the notion of a new linguistic dispensation to recent shifts in the language/society interface is entirely justified by the facts.

I argue that terms like bilingual or multilingual are inappropriate in order to describe this verbal interaction because these terms presuppose that linguistic production is divided in categories in advance. Instead I suggest the term polylingual as more sufficient in describing the fluent use of linguistic features which are locally constructed as categories of linguistic features, regardless of how linguistic features are categorised in society at large. Using sequentially based micro analysis I show how polylingual behaviour is used for a range of linguistic purposes. I focus on the interplay between polylingual behaviour and other linguistic resources used in e.g. performance in order to negotiate local identity and power relations.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Nevertheless, in Aragon, a region of Northern Spain close to the Pyrenees, three regional languages coexist. The number of studies on this phenomenon is scarce, and we can only associate this lack of research with the absence of enthusiasm with which language attitudes have traditionally been treated. In this context, based on a sample of students in one of the four years of compulsory secondary education, the study has two objectives. First, attitudes towards the three languages present in the area are explicated (i.e. Aragonese, Spanish and Catalan), and are also approached in relation to the two other foreign languages that are more present in the curriculum (French and English). Secondly, the influence of some of the main factors causing these attitudes is analysed.

The study reported in this paper approaches language learning as a process of socialisation that involves not only learning how to make sense of linguistic signs but also learning how to enact different social roles in particular institutions.

The analysis focuses on the interactional profiles of two immigrant students in two types of communicative activities that are representative of the school context: responding to questions from an adult and cooperating with a peer in the resolution of a learning task. By shifting the focus of analysis from a decontextualised notion of communicative competence to the notion of ‘institutionally affiliated communicative competence’ and concentrating on issues such as the (1) the relationship between knowledge and participation, (2) language choice inside and outside school and (3) definitions of correctness in language use, the study reveals how the two students construct a highly ‘affiliated’ identity.",International Journal of Multilingualism

The data discussed were collected in a Taekwondo club in a multicultural area of Copenhagen stereotypically associated with socially underprivileged youth. The analysis focuses on parts of a particular conversation where the boys are engaged in a linguistic competition. They claim linguistic competence by explicitly referring to school success and demonstrate linguistic competence through a creative mixture of playful linguistic activities (among them a spelling competition) in which several different languages and styles are involved. The analysis is discussed in relation to broader discourses about leisure sport as socially integrating, and it is concluded that in the boys’ interaction the stereotypes invoked by these discourses are indeed creatively brought about and renegotiated.",International Journal of Multilingualism

This story has been read as a parable for assimilated Jews and successful immigrants.

This language shift makes intergenerational communication, especially with folk left at home, often problematic. Similarly, intragenerational communication may equally be difficult among young relatives from families having adopted different societal languages. The present study draws from observational speech data of immigrant teenagers of Congolese origin during a seven-week reunion. The teenagers had adopted, respectively, French and English to the detriment of Kiswahili (for both sets) and of French for those who spoke only English.

Whatever language Tunisians use in these discourses, Arabic, French, or English, they use them in similar ways, so that there is standardisation despite linguistic diversity.

By analysing the contact between French and Tunisian Arabic, on the one hand, and Spanish and Northern Moroccan Arabic, on the other, the purpose is to illustrate how the coexistence of diglossia and bilingualism within the same speech community facilitates interference from the foreign language into the low variety of the local system. This transfer can be more visible at the lexical level, in coherence with general tendencies of language contact, but also may be reflected at the structural level, in spite of the considerable typological distance between the languages involved. The results will also show that high competence in the source language permits certain borrowed items not to show the required integration in the low variety of the receiving language, and, thus, may expedite the change processes.",International Journal of Multilingualism

By showing how multiple identities are created and negotiated in the course of talk, projected through particular ways of speaking, the analysis attests to language and particularly phonology as an active site for the construction of identity.

To illustrate these strategies in context, the paper draws from classroom interaction excerpts: small groups of children (ages 8–10) discover meaning in a text in a language unknown to them (Mandarin written in the Chinese script). International research has long documented the metalinguistic abilities shown by bilinguals in approaching new languages (e.g. Bialystok, 2001; Cummins, 2000), and their facilitative nature for further language learning. This paper documents how competence in two languages, and specifically heightened language awareness, serve as resources to build knowledge in context.",International Journal of Multilingualism

This study is a longitudinal survey of EFL learners in Urmia University in Azerbaijan, Iran, during 2002–2004. It compared 56 Turkish–Persian bilinguals with their 42 Persian monolingual peers in terms of their performance on the First Certificate of English (FCE) tests of reading comprehension in three phases. The subjects, who fell within the age range of 18–24, were similar in social (socioeconomic status), psychological (motivation and attitudes) and educational (previous exposure to other languages) orientations. Analysis of the data submitted to independent t -tests indicated that bilinguals performed significantly better than monolinguals in the reading comprehension tests in all the three phases of investigation, thus strengthening the argument that bilingualism may be a good predictor of achieve...",International Journal of Multilingualism

It assumes that the multilingual mental lexicon contains not only lexemes but also language-specific lemmas; language-specific lemmas may activate language-specific morphosyntactic procedures in speech production, and third language learners' activation of lemmas for target language items may be influenced by the lemmas already stored in their mental lexicon through their previous language acquisition, especially second language acquisition. The interlanguage data for the study are from adult learners with Chinese as their first language, English as their second language and German as their third language, and those with Japanese as their first language, English as their second language and Chinese as their third language. The research findings provide empirical evidence that the activation of second language lemmas is the ma...",International Journal of Multilingualism

Children therefore study these languages at primary school. In this paper I explore how six eight-year-old Luxembourgish children use and learn German, French and English in formal and informal settings over a period of one year. Their eagerness to learn and use German and English contrasted with their cautious and formal approach to the learning of French. My findings demonstrate that second language learning in a multilingual country is not an 'automatic' or 'natural' process but, rather, children's language behaviour depends on their personal goals, interests, competence, confidence and understanding of what counts as appropriate language use. These factors are influenced by the formal approach to language learning at school.",International Journal of Multilingualism

Maltese and English are presently the official languages of the island. Nevertheless, Italian was never completely erased from the Maltese linguistic scene and over the past years its popularity has increased considerably because of the influence of Italian television programmes. In this study the impact of input from television programmes is investigated, as well as the extent to which the ‘italiano televisivo’ variety is acquired in Malta. Fifty-two subjects, including guided and spontaneous learners of Italian L2, provide an oral narrative account by means of which their degree of competence in Italian verbs is investigated. Results reveal that there are no statistically significant differences in the performance of the two groups of learners and that the influence of the Italian media has been far-reaching.

Past research indicated that English L1 acquirers do not include regular -s inflection within compounds, whereas they do include irregulars (*clawsmarks versus teethmarks) and claimed that this was an innate constraint. More recent research contradicts this claim in the case of L2 acquirers. The aim of this study is to report on further work investigating this issue with bilingual learners in an EFL setting. The results indicate that there is a significant contrast between native and non-native speakers of English in novel compound production and also show that there is a significant effect on the proficiency level of the three groups tested. These results are discussed in the light of the predictions made by the levelordered morphology model and the dual-mechanism model and also consider the role of the learners' L1s and the...",International Journal of Multilingualism

In a listening task, adult multilingual learners of English heard these utterances in a constructed short story and then judged their grammatical correctness and semantic appropriateness under time pressure. They then performed a written post hoc grammatical judgement and correction task on the same sentences at their own pace. Our first hypothesis was that these multilingual learners would a priori be highly metalinguistically aware, and thus adept at sifting formal grammatical information from semantic information both online as they heard the items, as well as post hoc in the written task. We also expected that lesser as well as more experienced multilingual participants would be equally proficient at analysing the grammatical con...",International Journal of Multilingualism

Crosslinguistic Influence in Relation to School Grade and Language Dominance in EFL,2005,"Cross-linguistic influence (CLI) is receiving increasing attention in multilingual learners (Cenoz et al., 2001). Research with bilingual learners has analysed CLI in relation to language dominance (see, for instance, Hulk & Muller, 2000; Yip & Stephen, 2000) and to language dominance and grade in school settings (Cenoz, 2003; Lasagabaster, 2003a; Sanz, 2000). The aim of this study is threefold: (a) to analyse the relationship between CLI and grade; (b) to investigate whether learners transfer more content words than function words; and (c) to analyse whether language dominance (in Catalan, Spanish or balanced bilingualism) moderates the relationship between CLI and grade. We examine CLI as measured through the use of borrowings and lexical inventions of EFL bilingual Catalan–Spanish learners (n=474) ranging from grades 5 to 12 in a writing task. The analyses of variance lead us to conclude that (a) learners at higher grades use fewer borrowings and lexical inventions; the differences are statistically si...",International Journal of Multilingualism

The result of this hypothesised cognitive process is referred to as a ‘system shift’, which is intended to refer to a shift in lexical knowledge from a source to a guest system. The proposal is supported by preliminary data derived from three different studies with speakers of Italian as a third or additional language. It is proposed that two factors may contribute to the realisation of a system shift and to blocking L1 transfer in favour of transfer from a non-native language: perception of correctness and association of foreignness. It is also argued that the existence of system shifts gives rise to potential methodological problems for r...",International Journal of Multilingualism

Our study is based on an earlier survey carried out in Nicosia, Cyprus and we compare attitudes to language and reported language use in the two communities. We thereby highlight the significance of sociolinguistic variables on similar groups of speakers. We further extend our investigation to include codeswitching practices in the London community. Analysis of language attitudes and use within the Greek-Cypriot population of London, and comparisons with findings in Nicosia, reflect symbolic forces operating in the two contexts. Despite obvious differences between the two communities, (most obviously the official languages and distinct cultural backgrounds of the two nations), the Greek Cypriot Dialect continues to play an active role in both. English is however the ‘default choice’ for young Cypriots in the UK and Standard Modern Greek occupies a much more limited role than in Cyprus. It is argued that differences in language attitudes and use can be interpreted in light of different market forces operating in the nation (i.e. Cyprus) and the Diaspora (i.e. UK).",International Journal of Multilingualism

We particularly focused on proficiency-level effects and on the role of the task type in the use of request acts peripheral modification devices. We ascertained participants' degree of bilingual competence by means of a bilingualism test, which was designed on the basis of previous research (Li Wei, 2000). Additionally, a level placement test was distributed to our participants, and their performance was assessed on the basis of the ACTFL proficiency guidelines. Data for our analysis were collected by means of an open discourse completion test and a role-play task. Results from our analysis point to differences between bilinguals' and monolinguals' use of peripheral modification devices. More specifically our study shows that (1) L3 learners of English employed request modifiers more frequently and appropriately than L2 English learners, (2) intermediate learners performed better than beginner learners both in the oral and written task, and (3) the written task allowed for a wider use of peripheral modification devices although results also show that internal modification devices were highly employed in the oral task. Findings from our study seem to call for further research on the pragmatic competence of third language learners of English thereby considering other speech acts or pragmatic aspects and also by analysing subjects from different linguistic backgrounds.",International Journal of Multilingualism

It takes Cook (1999), Grosjean (2000) and Herdina and Jessner's (2002) multilingual (rather than monolingual) parameters as a basis for the design of the questionnaire on attitudes. In this way, instead of questioning the respondents about each of their three languages independently, in the traditional fashion, these three languages are put forward as a unit.

Nevertheless, we observed some properties of the German interlanguage that seem to indicate an influence of the second foreign language English on the first foreign language German. We focused our investigation on the processing of the V2 mechanism in German and the fact that it is in certain cases replaced by a SVO ordering, which seems to be a transfer from English. However, an analysis of the SVO ordering in the German interlanguage showed that this syntactic processing is not the result of a transfer from English. By analysing sentence processing as a derivational process in terms of a minimalist grammar, we concluded that the SVO ordering is a derivational strategy of separating adjuncts from the process of morphological checking to derive the syntactic ...",International Journal of Multilingualism

Qualitative and qualitative data show that the bilinguals tend to be more effective and persistent learners of the target language than monolinguals, that they are able to benefit from their metalinguistic awareness, though there are differences between the schools in the degree of perception of this.
