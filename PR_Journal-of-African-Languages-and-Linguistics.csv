https://doi.org/10.1515/jall-2023-2003,Maria Bulakh,The first person prefixes in South Ethio-Semitic,2023,"South Ethio-Semitic (SES) is a genealogical branch of Ethio-Semitic (ES), a subgroup of Semitic found almost entirely in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The paper considers two features characteristic of several South Ethio-Semitic languages. Firstly, the Prefix Conjugation displays a common 1 sg/ 1 pl prefix in various SES languages. Secondly, an innovative 1 pl suffix is often employed in the Prefix Conjugation. In forms with 1 sg/ 1 pl syncretism, this suffix takes over the functional load of the plural marker. Both features are innovative in SES, and their absence from a number of languages in each of the main subbranches suggests areal diffusion rather than a shared innovation going back to the Proto-SES level. In former studies, it has been suggested that the innovative 1 pl suffix was borrowed from Cushitic and that its introduction has triggered the 1 sg/ 1 pl syncretism. This hypothesis is critically reassessed in the present paper, which considers in detail various patterns of 1 sg/ 1 pl syncretism and various patterns of its interaction with the 1 pl suffix, and offers a tentative reconstruction of their emergence and spread in the languages in question.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

We explore whether the complementizers are in free variation, as reported in all descriptive and pedagogical work. Our study primarily relies on corpus data, which we supplement with native speaker judgments. We find that the complementizers are not in free variation, but in fact are affected by a number of factors known to affect embedded clauses cross-linguistically, including predicate class, person features of the main-clause subject, and mood in the embedded clause. We conclude that the complementizers ultimately reflect subtle, pragmatic factors concerning how the truth of the embedded clause should be evaluated. Our study expands on previous work on languages with so-called “dual-complementizer” systems.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Our analysis revealed that in the Efik language, nearly fifty body-centered lexemes serve as the primary labels for a variety of feeling states. The identified emotion terms incorporated specific body parts, various parts of the face, as well as the generalized body. In each instance, the body referent constituted part of the internal structure of the feeling label. Our findings complement existing emotion research examining the cultural scripting of emotion experiences as well as their expression and communication.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Like other Kwa languages, Akebu has both linear types of adpositions. Prepositions are not numerous and are fully grammaticalized. Two prepositions are used very widely, one of them expressing a comitative meaning and a number of related ones, the other having a generalized locative meaning, as well as other ones. In contrast, postpositions are more numerous, but most of them are weakly grammaticalized relator nouns that express the meanings of locational orientations and keep nominal morphology and independent uses. Still, grammaticalized postpositions are also present, the most common of them being a postposition that expresses apudessive, i.e. near, next to, orientation.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

We elaborate on this work by dealing with Niger-Congo languages that have restructured their inherited noun classification in a particular way. The inherited system entailing a strong parallelism between agreement-based gender and affix-based noun inflections shifted toward one where the gender system is reduced to an animacy-based opposition while nominal inflection maintains a considerable amount of original complexity with semantic criteria beyond those of the innovative gender distinction. While the phenomenon as such is not a new discovery, its typological relevance has gone unrecognized so far. We argue that such cases of restructured gender systems in Niger-Congo prima facie suggest themselves as candidates for a new type of concurrent noun classification, both from a synchronic and diachronic perspective. We present a detailed description of the phenomenon in the Guang language Gonja and determine whether or how it can be integrated in the available typology. We also survey its wider distribution and discuss some recurrent historical aspects of its emergence in the family.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Adopting the Canonical Typology approach, I assess the degree of canonicity in Mande GTs based on their formal and semantic properties. I show that verbal grammatical tones are mainly realized as replacive in Mande; they are independent from segmental morphemes and may be strongly influenced by surface phonology. Verbal GTs tend to be used in idiosyncratic sets of TAMP constructions and form phonologically determined inflectional classes in Mande, as in many other African languages. I argue that GTs attested in Perfective and Irrealis constructions in modern Mande languages are likely to be an old phenomenon already present in Proto Mande. The consistency of morphological tone assignment in Mande verbs suggests that GTs may be genetically quite stable morphological markers.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

This paper aims at comparing the formal and semantic features of kin terms across the languages of the Nuba Mountains in order to provide historical evidence for their transmission through inheritance or their possible diffusion via language contact. The comparative study surveys the kinship terminologies of 10 languages belonging to the three phyla attested in the Nuba Mountains (i.e. Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan and Kadu). In the first part of the paper, I analyze the morphosyntactic properties and functions of kin terms. By adopting a componential perspective of analysis, I then focus on the semantics of kin terms in the languages of the sample. The comparison eventually illustrates a high degree of typological variation whose origins can be traced back to the different genetic affiliations of the Nuba Mountain languages. It is also argued that matter and/or pattern borrowing can possibly occur in the domain of kin terms. However, language contact is less significant than shared sociocultural factors in triggering formal and semantic similarities across different kin terminologies. Above and beyond, the study intends to contribute to the ongoing debate on whether the Nuba Mountains constitute an ‘accretion’ zone and to point out some instances of micro-scale linguistic convergence between the languages of the region.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1515/jall-2022-8898,Nicholas Rolle; Ethelbert Emmanuel Kari,Tone and prosodic recursion in Degema nouns and noun phrases,2023,"This paper presents the first systematic study of tone in nouns and noun phrases in Degema. From a database of approximately 1,000 nouns, we find that nouns fall into three main tone patterns: /L-L/ (48% of nouns), /H-H/ (18%), and /L-HH/ (13%). This last case is theoretically important in that it includes cases where two separate H tones associate to the same tone-bearing unit, in violation of the Obligatory Contour Principle. In isolation, nouns are subject to two basic tone rules which alter their underlying forms: downstep is inserted between two final H’s (e.g. /H-H/ → [H ↓ H]), and H is inserted at the end of an all-low sequence (e.g. /L-L/ → [LH]). The combined effect of these rules is that virtually all nouns and noun phrases have a pitch change. Further, we catalog tonal effects found on nouns in 33 distinct modificational contexts within the noun phrase. We attribute these tonal effects to whether modifiers plus the noun form phonological phrases (φ) or phonological words (ɷ), and whether they form recursive prosodic structures, e.g. of the type ( ( A )φ B )φ. By positing recursive structure, we can localize tonal effects to an outermost prosodic layer (e.g. φ [+max] ), innermost layer (e.g. φ [+min] ), non-inner or outermost layers (e.g. φ [-max] ), or to the prosodic category as a whole (i.e. all layers of a φ).",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Contact-induced changes outside the phonological domain, however, are less commonly recognized. This paper provides a first ever analysis of morphological influence from Khoisan languages in Yeyi, a Bantu language spoken in Botswana and Namibia. Firstly, Yeyi has a set of lexical verbs that take an obligatory prefix i- or ra- , and both these prefixes and many of the verbs on which they occur are of Khoisan origin. Secondly, Yeyi has four verbal derivational suffixes that have been copied from Khoisan languages. The description of these contact-induced changes in Yeyi shows that contact with Khoisan languages, especially those of the Khoe family, involved extensive bilingualism. Dialectal difference in Yeyi furthermore suggests that Khoisan contact was more intense in Botswana than in Namibia. As some linguistic changes appear to derive from Khoisan languages that are not spoken in the vicinity of Yeyi, the language contact situation in which they arose was quite different from the one that occurs today.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Hyman,High tone bumping in Runyankore,2022,"In this study I present the unusual properties of a rule of High Tone Bumping (HTB) which occurs in certain languages of the Rutara subgroup of Bantu. By this process, the final H tone of a word or clitic “bumps” a preceding H tone one syllable to the left, e.g. /kaawá=kí/ → kááwa=kí ‘what coffee?’ (as realized utterance-medially). The triggers consist of /H/ CV monosyllables as well as VCV words whose final syllable is /H/. Since these can interact with each other, frequently with V+V vowel coalescence, this produces H tone sequences of trigger-targets in which each H appears to be bumped one syllable to the left. I present the facts of HTB in some detail and offer two synchronic analyses, one involving a left-to-right iterative rule, the other recognizing H*-marked tone spans that can be globally accessed to apply HTB all at once. I conclude by considering possible historical origins of HTB.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Landuma shows agreement in animacy and, for inanimate nouns, radical alliterative agreement , a type of agreement conditioned by phonology: the first phoneme of the agreement prefix is conditioned by the first phoneme of the controlling noun. This type of agreement has much in common with agreement in noun class but is governed by essentially different mechanisms. Radical alliterative agreement is a challenge for linguistic theory, because it contradicts the generally adopted Principle of Phonology-Free Syntax and the understanding of phonological elements as unilateral entities. Radical alliterative agreement has been previously found in some other languages, first of all in the Kru languages (Niger-Congo) and in the Arapesh languages (New Guinea). The authors who have dealt with radical alliterative agreement have suggested a number of alternative descriptions in order to avoid theoretical problems. Some of the possible alternatives are also discussed in this paper.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

https://doi.org/10.1515/jall-2022-2025,Mercy Bobuafor,Comparative constructions in Tafi,2022,"This paper describes the constructions and strategies available in Tafi, a KA-Ghana-Togo-Mountain language, for indicating relations of similarity, equality or superiority among two or more entities or events with respect to a property. Drawing on typological studies of comparison, I demonstrate that Tafi’s dedicated comparative constructions, that is, equivalents of English sentences like The pig is more dirty than the duck involve serial verb construction (SVC) subtypes. For superiority, the parameter (or property, ‘dirty’) of the comparison is expressed by the V1 in the SVC while V2 is the ‘exceed’ verb. For equality, the parameter is the V1 and the V2 is the ‘be.equal’ verb. The V2s in these SVCs co-lexicalise both the mark (e.g. ‘than’) and index (e.g. ‘more’) of the comparison. The paper discusses the contact-driven influences from areal grammar and from Ewe, the dominant lingua franca for Tafi speakers, on the linguistic expression of comparison. The ‘exceed’ comparative structure found in African languages has been attributed to areal grammaticalisation. I further argue that the operator verb sɔ/sɔ̃ ‘be.equal’ in the Tafi equality SVC is borrowed from Ewe. Similarity constructions involve the semblative nâsí . Similarity is also signalled through the verb yi ‘resemble’. I also explore the ordinal verb bhusó ‘do.first’ as a lexical comparative. Furthermore, I argue that Tafi, like many other Kwa languages, does not formally code a superlative. Superlative readings are inferred from the context and from non-dedicated linguistic indicators such as intensifiers.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The frequent emergence of Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM) markers from deictic motion verbs in particular, has also been extensively detailed in the literature. This paper focusses on the less well-known link between associated motion, a category of functional morphemes expressing (deictic) motion events, and TAM, in a language contact situation. Specifically, it provides a synchronic and diachronic description of three associated motion prefixes, joo- , tóó- and koo - , found in the Tanzanian Bantu language Rangi, spoken in an area of high linguistic diversity. It proposes that the prefix joo - encodes movement towards a deictic centre, tóó- encodes movement towards a goal which is not the deictic centre, and koo - encodes movement away from a deictic centre. It further contends that while tóó - and koo - have maintained a purely deictic function, joo - has grammaticalised to assume an additional function whereby it encodes future tense, possibly aided by the absence of a dedicated future tense marker in the language. This three-way morphological encoding of spatial relations on the verb form is not a common characteristic of East African Bantu languages. However, this paper proposes that the system in Rangi can be accounted for on the basis of cross-linguistically widely attested pathways of grammatical change.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Assuming that the ‘unmarked’ grade 1 form can be either singular or plural, we show that the morphology is more systematic than has been previously suggested. Roughly half of our dataset can be treated as synchronically regular, and in more than half the remainder the only exceptional features are simple alternations of lexical quantity or voice quality. Less than a quarter exhibit more unpredictable irregularities. With regard to tone, we posit nine classes that describe the patterns of tonal alternation between the grade 1 form and the more marked form of the noun; 60% of our dataset fall into just three of these classes. The tone classes show considerable cross-dialect validity even between a four-tone dialect (Luanyjang, Rek cluster) and a three-tone dialect (Agar).",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

While the High tone of a morpheme which precedes the stem is shown to be underlyingly pre-linked, those found after the beginning of the stem are argued to be underlyingly floating. This latter group of High tone autosegments can be shown to exclusively dock onto the first and last tone bearing units (TBUs) of the prosodic stem. This domain is not isomorphic with the morphological stem in that it must include the entire morphological stem as well as any of 3 different categories of enclitics which follow. The docking of the underlyingly floating Hs is shown to follow an edge-in process whereby a single H docks onto the initial TBU of the prosodic stem, a second H docks onto the final TBU of the prosodic stem, and any additional High tones remain floating, being phonologically inert. The paper provides an extensive range of newly presented data on this understudied Bantu language and constitutes a rare case of the prosodic stem being motivated by tonological factors.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The analysis shows that the semantic category of a site subsumed under Path is exclusively expressed by an adposition. The adpositions can be specific and general locatives. The specific locatives show a specific type of topological relation (for instance, verticality as in tatʃtʃ ‘below, under,’ horizontality as in fit ‘front,’ containment as in wɨst’ ‘in’) between figure and ground entities, but not the general locatives. Besides, static positional verbs encode the conflation of the fact of locatedness with a manner of the positioning of a figure. Based on Talmy’s Motion event typology, the present study has identified that Amharic uses a satellite-framed pattern in static locative constructions exclusively. Moreover, based on Ameka &amp; Levinson’s typology of locative predication, Amharic can be classified under type Ia where a language uses a dummy verb in basic locative construction.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The aim of the research is threefold: to contribute to language documentation, to provide a systematic description and analysis of the morphosyntactic properties of Esahie action nominals, and to offer a typological assessment of these constructions. We argue that action nominalization in Esahie primarily involves a composite strategy: a morpho-syntactic operation, invariably involving affixation, and a concomitant prosodic operation in the form of a change in tonal melody. As far as the derivation of action nominals is concerned, it appears that in Esahie, tone raising is not simply a phonologically-conditioned prosodic effect, but plays a morphemic role. Further, depending on the arity of the base verb, nominalization may or may not be coupled with incorporation of the internal argument, which derives a form of synthetic compounding, as in the English truck-driving type. Based on the seminal works by Koptjevskaja-Tamm, Maria. 1993.  Nominalizations . London: Routledge; Koptjevskaja-Tamm, Maria. 2006. Nominalizations.

We identify an interesting wh - movement asymmetry – unlike all other wh - movement structures, ‘how’ questions may not be formed via the focus-marked or cleft strategy. We document a number of other attested wh - structures in the language, including long-distance wh - movement, partial wh - movement, long-distance wh - in-situ, and multiple wh - questions.

Such stops were elicited in initial, intervocalic, and pre-lateral positions through a picture naming task. Sixty Ga-dominant and Ga-English children at 5-, 6 1/2 -, and 8-years of age were tested. All age groups showed some difficulty with the doubly articulated stops, but this was relative to voicing, phonological environment, age, and input. Performance on the voiceless labio-velar stop was better than on the voiced labio-velar stop, and better in intervocalic position than in word-initial and pre-lateral positions. Older children performed better than younger children and Ga-dominant children better than Ga-English children. Performance was better when children did not receive a prompt than when they did. Analysis of modifications reveals frequent processes of simplification to labial singleton stops, some voicing changes, and the occurrence of processes of vowel insertion between the stops and /l/. These findings are discussed in terms of universals of speech sound acquisition, the role of input, and the influence of language-specific factors on children’s performance.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The main factors for foot-parsing are: types of initial consonants, types of internal consonants and vocalic combinations; directionality (left to right) is a secondary factor. Segmentation into feet is relevant for the realization of tone. Disyllabic feet are subdivided into two types, heavy and light; heavy feet have a long vowel in the initial syllable, while light feet have a short vowel in this position which is susceptible to elision (depending on phonotactics).

We argue that voiced plosives are weight bearing and therefore considered as moraic when in coda position in this language. We attribute the triggering of the gemination in the reduplicative perfective with roots having final voiced plosives to compensatory lengthening in order to make up for the loss of a mora as motivated by Hayes (1989). Gemination, rather than vowel lengthening, occurs because, as stated by de Chene and Anderson (1979) compensatory lengthening of vowels only occurs in a language where vowel length is contrastive.

The construction in question consists of a form of ya ‘go’ plus a verb in the subordinate imperfective paradigm. It is argued that this construction works at the level of actionality (“lexical aspect” or “aktionsart”), rather than constituting an aspectual operator sensu stricto. The overall actional profile of this verbal unit is that of a degree achievement (Dowty 1979) or directed activity (Croft 2012), i.e. a process of change along a property scale. This change is construed as involving a plurality of successive steps. The contribution of the lexical item and its arguments is that of a property scale and/or target state. Throughout the description remarkable semantic parallels to a structure-wise comparable construction in Spanish (Romance, Indoeuropean) are pointed out. These structural and semantic parallels have implications for an oft-mentioned grammaticalization path leading from a motion-based construction to a marker of progressive aspect (Heine and Kuteva 2002, among others). The description of the construction is complemented by a note on a frequent collocation with an instrumental infinitive of the same verb stem.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

I show that the opposition between the two perfective auxiliaries attested in Kakabe is best analyzed in terms of operator focus and therefore extend this notion to Mande languages for the first time. This study analyzes operator focus on the perfective in natural speech. It leads to the discovery of new contexts relevant for the description of focused perfectives, such as performative speech acts and utterances with mental state predicates.

This paper investigates the internal structure of Dàgáárè SVCs and other verb sequence constructions such as multi-aspectual constructions (MACs) and coordinate structures. Applying a variety of syntactic and semantic tests, the paper distinguishes SVCs from MACs and coordination and shows the relation between MACs and coordination. Based on the results of the tests, I argue that although MACs have some properties of SVCs, they are not SVCs.

Within the lexicon and phoneme inventories of the surveyed varieties, no obvious indications of a substrate were found, including in data collected among the formerly Kwadi-speaking Kwepe, and among the Kwisi and Twa foragers, who have been hypothesized to constitute a remnant layer of non-Bantu, non-Khoisan foragers in the Namib desert.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

We present our discovery that Kinande, apparently unique among Bantu languages, grammaticalizes this type of causation with a specialized morpheme. In sociative causatives, the causer causes through social interaction rather than physical manipulation (direct causation) or words (indirect causation). We propose sociative causation in Kinande more exactly means ‘y carries out a subevent of P to help x do P.’ Helping here is by doing and is not comitative: rather, it is partitive – each actor does part of the action. This accounts for the classes of verbs that can undergo sociative causation. We establish that the construction is mono-clausal and note that the sociative morpheme is closely related to the benefactive applied morpheme. A second extension that occurs in this construction marks transitivity. We observe that the transitive extension can co-occur with the passive extension which tells us there is more than one voice projection in Kinande. Finally, we look more closely at the partitive reading of the caused event and note that the partitivity can be morpho-syntactically manifested either through partitive marking of the object of the caused event or through partitive marking of the caused event itself.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Bickmore,Unaltered morphemes as phonological triggers and targets in Rutooro,2019,"Rutooro, a Bantu language spoken in western Uganda, exhibits two processes common to Bantu languages: Mid Vowel Harmony (MVH), by which a high vowel is lowered to mid if it follows a mid root vowel, and Consonant Mutation (CM), by which a high front vowel of certain morphemes trigger a change in the immediately preceding consonant. In forms where both rules could potentially apply, CM applies, but MVH does not, even though its structural description is met. Ultimately, it is shown that MVH is blocked when an alveolar fricative intervenes between the trigger and the target. The most anomalous forms are those that contain the short causative / -i / and the Perfective suffix / -ir /. In some forms CM would be expected to apply, but does not, and in other forms MVH is expected to be blocked, but is not. The key to the analysis lies in the fact that CM is not a purely phonological process, but rather is only triggered by a small set of specific morphemes. The surface anomalies in the perfect forms can all be accounted for if one formalizes the relevant processes as only being triggered (or blocked) by unaltered [ -ir ].",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

We also discuss class indexation on nominal modifiers (adjectives, numerals, demonstratives and indefinite markers) as well as subject and object pronominals. We demonstrate that Kwa languages tend to follow the typological tendencies pertaining to class marking on nouns and class indexation, e.g. the Agreement hierarchy (Corbett, Greville G. 1979.

The benefactive/malefactive construction licenses the addition of an indirect object with a benefactive, malefactive, or other goal-like role. The construction is often marked by the verbal extension -D ; notably, however, an indirect object with a benefactive/malefactive role can appear even if the applicative extension is absent, with a tendency for a benefactive reading to be associated with the presence of the affix, and a malefactive reading with the absence of the affix. The accompaniment applicative construction is always marked by the verbal extension -N , which attaches to an intransitive or transitive stem and marks the presence of an accompanier of the applied clause subject. Unlike the usual situation with applicatives, where the ‘applied’ argument bears a core argument role, the applied argument in the accompaniment applicative construction appears as an oblique dependent of the verb. We discuss the complicated verbal morphology used to express benefactive and comitative/instrumental applicatives, and the syntactic realization of the applied argument in each type.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Less well known, however, are some asymmetries involving the frequency and distribution of [+ATR] and [-ATR] vowels. In addition to being dominant, [+ATR] vowels are subject to restrictions on their occurrence in certain classes of function words and affixes and occur with far lower overall frequency than [-ATR] vowels. In essence, they pattern like a marked sound class. This paper focuses on some implications of these findings for a theoretical topic of interest: markedness relations involving tongue root features. The Diola-Fogny patterns conform quite well to the expectations of a traditional understanding of featural markedness, which equates the dominant value of a feature with the marked one. They are problematic, however, for a widely assumed view of tongue root markedness relations that treats [-ATR] as universally marked in high vowels. Under this view, marked patterning of all [+ATR] vowels (including high [+ATR] [ i ], [ u ]) is unexpected. I show that such patterning is intelligible in a framework in which markedness has a representational basis and in which [+ATR] quality is represented by a privative feature [ATR].",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

This pattern is extremely rare in languages of the world and has been argued to be unattainable. The Iraqw ablative case clitic has been reported as both source and location marker. New data shows that the directional case clitic, a goal marker, appears on locative constructions as well, but that it is used to express purpose rather than location. The data also shows that the ablative case clitic is found mainly in locational clauses with a main verb with a durative aspect. Based on this, I argue that in locative constructions, the ablative clitic expresses duration rather than location and I propose the reanalysis of the ablative marker in locative phrases as a durational marker. The notion of location does not need to be expressed overtly, but is a zero-marker. Therefore, the rare Source=Location≠ Goal pattern is no longer valid for Iraqw, and instead I propose the pattern Source≠ Location≠ Goal, which is common in languages of the world.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

These schools are located away from urban centres, with little or no basic infrastructure, hence the concept of “deep ruralness”. The participants were purposively sampled from among learners, teachers and head teachers to examine how learners’ affiliations with multilingualism could explain the preferred MoI, and the ways through which schools implement the use of an MoI in the curriculum. The findings show that Kiswahili and English were used as the MoI, even when the curriculum recommended indigenous languages and English.

In contrast, (preverbal) locatives in Sotho-Tswana and Nguni have been analysed as prepositional adjuncts, which cannot agree. Our paper compares locatives in Kinyarwanda (JD61) with locatives in these other Bantu languages and demonstrates that the Kinyarwanda locative system is essentially of the Chichewa/Herero type. We show that Kinyarwanda locatives are nominal in nature, can act as subjects, and agree with predicates and modifiers. However, even though Kinyarwanda has four locative noun classes (16, 17, 18 and 25), there is only one locative agreement marker (class 16 ha- ), which indiscriminately appears with all locatives, regardless of their noun class. We explain this fact by arguing that noun class features in Kinyarwanda do not participate in locative agreement; instead, the invariant class 16 marker expresses agreement with a generic feature [location] associated with all locatives. We offer a syntactic analysis of this peculiar aspect of Kinyarwanda locative agreement, and we propose a parameter that accounts for the relevant difference between Kinyarwanda and Chichewa/Herero-type Bantu languages.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Although these languages dispose of a large and complex prefixing noun class systems which are involved in expressing number distinctions, a subgroup of nouns uses a suffix for pluralisation. It is shown here that plural-suffixing nouns do not engage in the typologically rare process of phonological agreement copying as has been claimed previously. Instead, they are prefixed nouns, triggering alliterative agreement. Several scenarios about the origin and further development of the plural suffixes are presented. Synchronic data suggest that plural suffixes are older than the split of Nyun-Buy languages from a common ancestor. It is highly unlikely that it is borrowed from Mandinka, a regionally influential lingua franca which does not have noun classes. Instead, it seems plausible that plural suffixes have arisen through internal processes in which animacy and collective semantics have played a role. Potential candidates for a source morpheme for the plural suffix include a plural morpheme from the verbal domain or alternatively an associative plural. The role and impact of language contact and large scale borrowing on the extent of plural suffixation in the various Baïnounk languages is discussed.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

I call this construction the syntactically intransitive construction of transitive verbs, and illustrate it with examples from Tooro, a Bantu language of western Uganda. However, two important restrictions apply regarding the use of this construction. One is that among transitive verbs, only those causing a change of state that take human agents and inanimate objects may be used intransitively, with inanimate objects being promoted to the subject position. The second restriction is that this construction may only be used with the perfective ending - ire /- ere . This last point indicates that this construction is distinct from typical labile verb constructions that, in principle, occur in all tenses, aspects and moods. The analysis of the intransitive construction of transitive verbs inevitably raises the issue of the stative nature of perfective actions.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

In particular, the fact that Djibouti Somali uses mainly two suffixes to pluralize nouns, leads us to the hypothesis that the inflectional system of this variety consists of only two inflectional types. Basic non-derived nouns belong to what I call type A, whereas suffixed nouns belong to type B. This dichotomy is confirmed by the behavior of pitch accent with respect to both gender and syntactic case. Finally, I propose that the distinction between type A and type B can be accounted for, in the context of a formal analysis, by postulating the existence of a contrast between null vs. overt nominalizer.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

We find that most Chadic languages use the word for ‘mouth’, not ‘tongue’, to mean ‘language’, and that language names are formed by a tightly-knit phrase or compound ‘mouth-of X’ rather than by means of a derivational suffix. We propose that the Hausa ethnonymic prefix bà - is a reflex of the widespread Chadic root for ‘mouth’ (* bV ), having undergone a semantic development from ‘language-of X’ to ‘person-of X’. We note that the original root is still preserved in the Hausa word bàakíi ’mouth’, which contains an old West Chadic nominal suffix *- kV that would have been dropped in inalienable possession and compounds. We also propose that - áawáa , the modern-day suppletive plural of the ethnonymic prefix bà -, was originally a distinct derivational suffix indicating a community of people with common characteristics, and, further, that the - áncíi suffix now used to denote language names originally had a semantically broader meaning, connoting such qualities as style, mannerisms, and speech peculiarities.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Elle est une des premières études s’inscrivant en linguistique de corpus pour les langues bantoues, une démarche rarement adoptée pour cette famille de langues, de même qu’elle étudie une catégorie grammaticale généralement négligée dans les études linguistiques, c’est-à-dire l’adverbe. Nous décrivons les différents emplois de umeengo / umeenga : comme adverbe, mais aussi comme comparatif, et dans les emplois du verbe qui en émerge à l’étape suivante dans son évolution. Ses origines sont éclairées par un indice retrouvé en kinyarwanda, langue proche du kirundi, ainsi que dans la variante dialectale du kirundi parlée à l’ouest du Burundi, dans la région de l’Imbo. D’après ces éléments, il apparaît que cet adverbe est formé par univerbation, plus précisément par fusion d’un verbe conjugué, umenya (du verbe - meny - « connaître ») et du quotatif ngo « que ». Dans la suite du processus, à partir de cet adverbe épistémique, se forme un nouveau verbe, - meeng - « croire ; penser », différent de celui du départ, tant dans le sens qu’au niveau de la forme. Une telle évolution au sein de l’adverbe, qui naît d’un verbe et débouche lui-même à la naissance d’un autre verbe, est rare dans les langues du monde, de là l’intérêt de notre analyse. Dans cette étude, nous nous interrogeons sur la nature des processus à l’œuvre. Nous montrons que les changements structurels et sémantiques par lesquels l’adverbe umeengo / umeenga s’est formé sont à mettre sur le compte de la grammaticalisation. Dans le même ordre d’idée, nous analysons la formation du verbe - meeng - à partir de l’adverbe comme le résultat d’une dégrammaticalisation.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Wolof is usually said to possess a total of 10 noun classes (8 for the singular, 2 for the plural), marked today exclusively on agreement targets. We provide evidence that two more plural noun classes must be recognized, which have so far been misinterpreted as “collective” rather than plural: the evidence we provide is morphosyntactic (from verb agreement) as well as morphological (from class-related asymmetries in the paradigm of the indefinite article). As for method, the main thrust of the paper consists in showing that an accurate analysis of the Wolof data must make use of the three distinct notions “noun class”, “inflectional class” and “agreement class” (or gender). Under the analysis defended here, Wolof turns out to have a fairly complex gender system, featuring 17 distinct gender values. Our analysis – and especially the discussion of Wolof so-called “collectives” – also bears on the general theoretical issue of how to establish the values of the number category.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

This study provides experimental results on Dagbani vowel features from acoustic and perceptual psycholinguistic inquiries with the goal of better defining the vowel features and inventory. Basic formant frequencies of the vowels in different phonological contexts support the view that (1) vowels of all height specifications (including /a/) have [ATR] variants; (2) /i/ and /ɨ/ neutralise in harmonic contexts; and (3) mid vowels surface as low in non-final positions. Results of a perceptual psycholinguistic investigation of the neutralisation between mid and low vowels also show that in certain contexts, speakers are unable to perceive any distinction between different words with these vowels. The paper discusses the implications of these results on the Dagbani vowel inventory, evaluating the merits of different possible approaches in the process.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

It has a focus construction in which the focused element is placed in clause-initial position and marked with an extra-high tone. In this paper I discuss the functions of this focus construction, mostly based on a corpus of spontaneous discourse. The focus construction can mark focus on subjects, objects, adjuncts and verbs. Focus marking is usually interpreted as narrow focus on the focus-marked element, but the focus may be wider. Focus marking is not obligatory. In answers to questions, it is rarely used, except when the focused element is the subject. In other contexts, the focus construction is mostly used for contrastive purposes, indicating there are alternatives to the focused element or that the focused element is unexpected. These functions can be unified in the definition of focus marking as highlighting the common-ground update.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

It focuses on two tonal phenomena that have apparently not been reported elsewhere in Gur languages: root melodies associating to whole words and tonal overwriting. All singular suffixes are analyzed as being underlyingly toneless and receiving their surface tone by means of the root melody associating to the entire word, as though blind to the morpheme boundary. Association of tones to trimoraic words is dealt with by positing that the OCP is inactive. The non-singular (plural, collective and liquid) suffixes – with one exception – are underlyingly HL. The analysis of these forms distinguishes between non-overwriting suffixes, in which the word level tone is merely the sum of its parts, and overwriting suffixes, in which the tone of the suffix overwrites the final tone(s) of the root melody.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

On the basis of a three-speaker dataset, a classification is deduced from the singular-plural forms that are found in all three idiolects. As a result, a noun class is defined as the clustering of the intersection of singular-plural pairs across speakers. The complement of the intersection corresponds to the inter-individual variation. It is defined as any differences between two individuals in the representation of at least one linguistic variable. Thus, the paper provides a perspective of describing stability and variability by both deriving a prototype based on the intersection of multi-speakers’ data, and acknowledging and accounting for inter-individual variations. The method is argued to be better suited for urban and lingua franca linguistics.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

These Bantu languages acquired clicks through contact with both Khwe and Ju languages. However, they did not simply copy these Khoisan clicks words. They adapted them phonologically, resulting in a reduction of the click inventory and also integrated them into Bantu morphosyntax through the unusual process of paralexification. What is more, clicks do not only occur in words of Khoisan origin, but also spread to native vocabulary as a language-internal change, among other things through sound symbolism. Finally, calques and head-final nominal compounds in a number of these Bantu languages point to structural influence, most likely from Khwe. We argue that the contact-induced changes observed in the southwestern Bantu languages can be partly accounted for by the language shift of native Khoisan speakers who imposed certain features from their native language on the Bantu language they acquired. In addition, Bantu speakers may have used clicks and other Khoisan-derived elements as an emblem for marking a separate identity, as they were not only maintained, but extended to native structures as well.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

If two or more potential controllers are present in a DP, usually the outermost (highest) one controls the entire inner string, as when Poss-N-Adj-Num is realized as [Poss O [N Adj Num]], which is simply an instance of the formula [C O T]. But several Dogon languages also have tonal patterns for certain DP configurations that cannot be generated by binary [T O C] or [C O T] patterns or any combination thereof. These call for an explicitly noncompositional constructional tonosyntactic model. Numerals, which in simple N-Num or N-Adj-Num sequences are tonosyntactically inert, play an interesting catalysing role in constructional tonosyntax, activating latent control potential in definites and (originally appositional) postposed possessors.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Marlo,On the number of object markers in Bantu languages,2015,"This paper describes the morphosyntactic diversity among Bantu languages in the number of pre-stem and post-stem object markers (OMs) that are allowed and discusses the factors responsible for this diversity. The number of OMs is sometimes highly restricted and sometimes seemingly unrestricted. Some languages have only pre-stem marking of objects; some have only post-stem marking; and some have both pre-stem and post-stem marking. Person-number, animacy, and locative noun classes are the basis for a number of morphosyntactic asymmetries in individual systems in whether objects are marked before or after the stem, though other factors such as grammatical relations are also involved. A handful of types of OMs, including locatives and the 1sg and reflexive markers, commonly allow languages to circumvent restrictions on object marking, allowing one more OM than usual. The number of OMs is also restricted by certain syntactic configurations such as passivization. A number of other issues that are important general considerations in the syntax of Bantu languages are shown to have at most a secondary role in determining the number of OMs that are allowed.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

However, these descriptions of the pattern have disagreed about the nature and distribution of the sounds involved. Such a pattern has been reported in a number of Bantu and non-Bantu languages, and it is intriguing because its phonetic basis is not obvious, since there is nothing rhotic about a front vowel or lateral about a non-front vowel. To clarify the facts and provide insight into this kind of pattern, a production study was conducted in which Luganda speakers produced the liquid in varying vocalic contexts. F1, F2, duration, mean harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), and intensity were measured. The results support the characterization of the liquid after a front vowel as a nonlateral tap, and elsewhere as a lateral sonorant. But the intensity data also show a continuum in the degree of tongue tip constriction, ranging from approximant to tap, depending on the frontness of both the preceding and following vowels. The pattern of distribution is thus more complex and gradient than has been evident from transcriptions alone.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

After identifying the following tone processes: Tone Lowering (TL), High Tone Spread (HTS) and Phrase Final L Tone Docking (PFLTD), the paper demonstrates that besides the traditional morphological noun classes known to exist in Bantu languages, nouns can also be classified on the basis of tone patterns. The application of TL results in two classes: a class of nouns whose first syllable only is affected by TL and another whose two or more syllables are affected. HTS on the other hand, produces three classes: nouns with a surface high falling contour on their first syllables, nouns with a surface high tone in this same position and those with a downstepped H on all its syllables. PFLTD on its part produces two classes: nouns with a surface utterance final L and those with a final H tone. Data analysis reveals that the behaviour of a noun vis-à-vis the application of TL, HTS and PFLTD depends on whether the noun is lexically toneless, high toned or low toned and whether a noun has a HH or H stem. Tone patterns in Bafut nouns seem to be a kaleidoscope of the historical changes reported in the literature about Grassfields Bantu languages.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1515/jall-2015-0004,Lameen Souag,Non-Tuareg Berber and the genesis of nomadic Northern Songhay,2015,"With massive borrowing resulting in systematic suppletion, the nomadic Northern Songhay languages, Tadaksahak and Tagdal, are some of the most striking products of intense language contact in Africa. While the importance of Berber in their formation is obvious, published comparisons have focused almost exclusively on Tuareg, the currently dominant Berber language of the region. This paper, however, demonstrates that Tuareg-Songhay contact alone cannot adequately account for their emergence. Tadaksahak at least seems to have as its substrate not Tuareg, but rather a Western Berber language closely related to Tetserrét, a small minority language of Niger; such a language also played a role in the development of Tagdal. Western Berber influence, however, is not reconstructible at the proto-Northern-Songhay level, despite being attested in most Northern Songhay languages individually. A closer look at the Western Berber stratum in Tadaksahak indicates that language shift there was accompanied by broader cultural changes, including a shift away from the regional norm of cross-cousin marriage towards the North African preference for patrilineal parallel cousin marriage. These linguistic and cultural changes may have been part of an effort to assert an identity as specialists in Islamic learning, following regional political shifts around the sixteenth century.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Its main proposal is that verbal forms have complex structure with internal boundaries that are relevant to tonal processes. The framework of the account, Distributed Morphology (DM), distinguishes between word-building operations that take place in Syntax, in Morphology, and in Phonology, and it is argued that constituency created in the course of these operations is reflected in the tonal melody of individual forms. The present analysis accounts for tonal contours of all forms that posed difficulty under previous treatments while presenting a number of significant theoretical advantages. Most importantly, it offers an insight into Setswana clause structure and defines in precise terms the role that tone plays in making morphosyntactic and prosodic structures phonologically explicit.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Clauses with object focus demonstrate ergative case marking on postverbal noun and pronoun agents, and an ergative morpheme is also bound to verbs. Other evidence for ergativity is that the ergative morpheme is morphologically and syntactically distinct from the passive morpheme. Ergative morphemes and constructions in Gaahmg are similar to those of other Nilo-Saharan languages, including Luwo, Päri, and Shilluk. The Gaahmg antipassive also resembles that of other Nilo-Saharan languages. Yet, unlike other languages with ergativity and antipassives, Gaahmg readily combines the antipassive with ergative, passive, and causative morphemes in the same verb form. The Gaahmg antipassive occurs in nominative-accusative structures, as well as in object-focus clauses with ergative-absolutive structures. Further, the antipassive co-occurs with the passive, as if both the nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive structures are simultaneously present in the same clause, and the language is currently shifting from one structure to the other.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Kula,Benefactive and substitutive applicatives in Bemba,2014,"Benefactive applicative constructions can encode a range of different meanings, including notably recipient, substitutive and plain benefactive readings, which are often distinguished in cross-linguistic studies. In Bantu languages, this distinction has not received much attention, in part because most Bantu languages do not formally distinguish between different readings of benefactive applicatives. In Bemba (Bantu M42, Zambia), by contrast, substitutive applicatives, where the action of the verb is performed by the agent instead of, on behalf of, or in place of someone else, are formally marked by applicative morphology in addition to a post-verbal clitic -kó , based on a grammaticalised locative demonstrative clitic. The paper provides a detailed discussion of the construction and proposes that the interpretation of substitutive applicatives results from the interaction of abstract applicative and locative semantics and depends on underlying metaphors of spatial and abstract location. Bemba benefactive applicatives thus provide an illustration of the complex function and interpretation of Bantu applicatives and locative markers more widely. The construction is interesting from a historical-comparative and typological perspective because of the particular grammaticalisation process from a locative source involved in the historical development of the construction, and because substitution is marked in addition to applicative marking.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The fronted element is marked with a cleft particle and for noun phrases, a demonstrative that we analyze as a relative pronoun is used. Verbal tone patterns are those that are found in dependent clauses rather than main clauses. Subject questions, clefts and relative clauses are marked with a verbal prefix é- , while non-subject questions, clefts and relative clauses are marked with a verbal prefix ə́- .

It shows that, although Bantu studies tend to concentrate on negation marked on the verb itself, post-verbal negative markers are well represented within the Bantu domain and high concentrations can be found in zones B, C, H and L. It is argued that locative pronouns, possessive pronouns and negative (answer) particles are recurrent sources of negative markers in Bantu languages. It is claimed that they take part in what is generally known as a Jespersen cycle: they initially reinforce the original negator and eventually become obligatory for the expression of negation resulting in a double negative construction.

Dagbani has a bidirectional [ATR] harmony, with [+ATR] as the dominant value. A root [i] triggers a left-to-right harmony targeting vowels in suffixes and clitics while the mid vowels [e, o] trigger a right-to-left direction of harmony targeting root vowels. There are two restrictions on harmony. First, a height similarity condition restricts harmony to a trigger and target that are both [+high] or [−high]. Second, a class of opaque consonants [l, ɾ, s] block the spread of [+ATR] between /i/ and an eligible vowel target. However, the opacity is unidirectional as the coronals do not block a right-to-left harmony.

This observation led to the classification of disyllabic verb inputs into two: a low-toned group with a contrastive, and a non-contrastive, syllable; and, a low-high-toned group with two contrastive syllables. Non-contrastive syllables are banned from the reduplicant, which is why reduplicants of the former group are monosyllabic, and, respect *[−High] (McCarthy and Prince 1995) just like monosyllabic verbs' reduplicants. Their final segment(s) are unparsed, and are deleted without compensatory lengthening, except in cases where the final segment becomes homorganic with the following consonant. The latter group's reduplicants are disyllabic with every segment parsed; homorganic assimilation of the reduplicant-final segment applies optionally; and, with the loss of (a) reduplicant-final segment(s), vowel lengthening applies to avoid a monosyllabic reduplicant and, consequently, *[−High]. *[−High] applies to distinguish outputs of the former group from outputs of monosyllabic/disyllabic adjectives.

Some place adverbials do not encode the distinction between the three spatial roles, but some nouns and some complex noun phrases distinguish between an allative case, which encodes a goal, and an essive/ablative case, which encodes either a location or a source. The derivational morphology of verbs includes a distinction between direction towards the deictic centre (centripetal) and direction not towards the deictic centre (centrifugal). There are constraints on the combinability between a place adverbial with a given semantic role and a verb with a given derivational status. Thus, a goal adverbial requires either a centrifugal verb or a centripetal verb. In clauses with a single place adverbial, moreover, a source adverbial requires either a non-directional verb or a centripetal verb, and a location adverbial requires a non-directional verb.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The results indicate that the Northern Songhay languages of the Sahara form a valid subfamily, even though no known historical records link Tabelbala to the others, and that Northern Songhay and Western Songhay (spoken around Timbuktu and Djenné) together form a valid subfamily, Northwestern Songhay. The speakers of Proto-Northern Songhay practised cultivation and permanent architecture, but were unfamiliar with date palms. Proto-Northwestern Songhay was already in contact with Berber and probably (perhaps indirectly) with Arabic, and was spoken along the Niger River. Proto-Songhay itself appears likely to have been in contact with Gur languages, confirming its relatively southerly location. This result is compatible with two scenarios for the northerly spread of Songhay. On Hypothesis A, Northern Songhay spread out from an oasis north-east of Gao, probably Tadmakkat or Takedda, and Northwestern Songhay had been spoken in areas west of Gao which now speak Eastern Songhay. On Hypothesis B, Northern Songhay spread out from the Timbuktu region, and Western Songhay derives from heavy “de-creolising” influence by Eastern Songhay on an originally Northern Songhay language. To choose between these hypotheses, further fieldwork will be required.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Unlike their affirmative counterparts, Kambaata negative relative verbs qualify as verbal adjectives (participles), because, apart from having verbal inflectional morphology and a completely verbal argument structure, they have also acquired adjectival morphology to indicate case/gender agreement with their head nouns. The combination of verbal and adjectival features is less balanced for agent adjectives, which retain fewer properties of the verbs they are based on; however, they are still able to govern objects and be modified by adverbial clauses. Kambaata verbal nouns behave almost entirely like verbs in relation to their dependents but as nouns with respect to the clause where they feature as arguments. I argue that the negative participle formation and the verbal noun formation are inflectional processes which change the word form word class from verb to adjective and verb to noun, respectively, but which preserve the properties of the lexeme word class (Verb). In contrast, the agent adjective formation is analysed as a derivational process with a greater impact on the lexeme word class.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

However, in Zulu, certain uses of class 17 are clearly non-locative. For example, class 17 demonstrative pronouns can refer to situations but not to places, while the class 17 subject marker is used when the preverbal subject is a conjunction of unlike classes. This paper explores the uses of class 17, to evaluate the traditional notion of its locative nature in Zulu. Syntactic analyses are given of the many constructions in which the class 17 subject marker appears, including inversions and non-verbal existential predication. It is shown that the unusual agreement pattern in copular constructions is due to agreement with a non-expletive class 17 pro, mirroring a pattern found in French and Dutch. The paper concludes that class 17 is essentially non-locative in Zulu, by arguing that the supposed locative properties can be attributed either to accidental class membership or to the fact that items historically related to class 17 lie outside the modern noun class paradigm.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

(2010), which is a revision of the theory first proposed by Talmy (1975, 1985). The revision of Talmy's theory on the semantics and syntax of motion events introduces a distinction between symmetrical and asymmetrical constructions and proposes to apply it to individual constructions and not to entire languages. In Bambara we find two different types of constructions both of which are asymmetrical: verb framing and satellite framing constructions. The verb framing construction expresses the path of motion in a finite verb, whereas manner of motion is encoded in an adverbial form or copredicative form, which is derived by means of -tɔ or -bagatɔ . The adverbial form precedes the finite form of the verb. The second type is a satellite framing construction where the manner of motion is expressed in a finite verb form and the path of motion by means of an infinitive form of the verb introduced by the morpheme kà . Some of the path verbs in the language have developed into prepositions together with the infinitive morpheme kà . Although this allows characterizing them as satellite framing, there are some features that set them apart from satellite framing constructions in languages like English, German or Polish. The first feature is that even those path verbs that develop into prepositions continue to function as full verbs in the language with no tendency to lose this function. The second distinguishing feature is the possibility of combining several path verbs in one clause. These features make Bambara resemble languages that have serial verb constructions, which belong to symmetrical constructions according to Croft et al.

They are encoded morphologically by a derivational suffix which has an uncharacteristic morphophonological realization. It triggers the gemination of the root-final consonant. In this paper, we examine whether this causative/applicative isomorphism is the result of a semantic split or rather the outcome of a phonemic merger. In the first case, the semantic extension must have happened from applicative to causative rather than the cross-linguistically more common evolution from causative to applicative, since the consonant gemination associated with these forms has its origin in the Proto-Bantu applicative suffix * - i d- . In the case of a phonemic merger, however, this applicative suffix would have become homophonous with an originally distinct suffix having a causative effect as the result of convergent morphophonological change. This morpheme cannot be the Proto-Bantu causative suffix * -ici- , which still has a residual causative use in Mbuun.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1515/jall.2011.008,Rose Letsholo,The syntactic distribution of argument and adjunct question word constructions in Ikalanga,2011,"This paper investigates the distribution of argument and adjunct question phrases in Ikalanga. It is argued that both adjunct and argument question phrases in this language are focused, but that the former are merged in the specifier of a focus phrase (which projects either within v P or higher than TP) while argument question phrases occur in the specifier of a focus phrase as a result of a syntactic operation, namely attract . Evidence that adjunct question phrases are base generated in spec-FocP rather than moved there while argument question phrases are moved to spec-FocP comes from morphological differences observed between the two construction types as well as movement tests. There are two main points of interest related to the distribution of adjunct question phrases. One has to do with the fact that Ikalanga has one word chini which means ‘how’ or ‘how come’. The paper argues that speakers distinguish chini ‘how’ and ‘how come’ based on their syntactic distribution, which is complementary. chini ‘how come’ is always merged in the specifier of FocP and can occur either on the left edge of the sentence or on the right edge of the sentence. chini ‘how’ on the other hand only occurs at the right edge of the sentence or between the verb and its complement. It is shown that although chini ‘how come’ seemingly occurs on the right edge of the sentence, this is a derived position: it is a position that results after a proposition, a TP, has been topicalized leaving behind chini in spec-FocP. The second point of interest concerning the distribution of adjuncts is the rather unusual position they occupy, namely between the verb and its complement. The paper proposes that these data can be analyzed successfully by adopting the proposal that a focus phrase projects within v P (see Ndayiregige, Linguistic Inquiry 30: 399–444, 1999, van der Wal, The disjoint verb form and an empty immediate after verb position, ZAS, 2006, among others, for similar proposals.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

While subjects and objects precede the verb, all oblique arguments and adjuncts follow it. Several diachronic hypotheses have been advanced to account for the word order type of Mande (Givón, Serial verbs and syntactic change: Niger-Congo, University of Texas Press, 1975, Heine and Reh, Grammaticalization and reanalysis in African languages, Helmut Buske, 1984, Claudi, Die Stellung von Verb und Objekt in Niger-Kongo-Sprachen: Ein Beitrag zur Rekonstruktion historischer Syntax, Universität zu Köln, 1993), none of which are fully satisfactory. This paper discusses new evidence from the syntax of modern Mande languages that may shed light on the historical development of the S-O-V-X word order. I argue, based on the unusual behavior of Mande postpositional phrases, that the development of S-O-V-X was a consequence of categorial reanalysis of constructions with deverbal nouns as verb phrases, with subsequent replacement of the older type of verb phrase by the newly introduced structure. The analysis is supported by a number of characteristic parallels between the syntax of Mande verb phrases and noun phrases, such as the absence, in some languages, of both verb-phrase-internal and noun-phrase-internal postpositional phrases, the absence of the genitive vs. accusative distinction, and identical restrictions on the number of complements of nouns and verbs.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Relative clause constructions provide the ideal context for testing the proposal. However, neither Kanerva's (Focus and phrasing in Chichewa phonology, Garland, 1990) study of Chichewa prosodic phrasing nor Watkins's (A grammar of Chichewa: A Bantu language of British Central Africa, University of Chicago, 1937) and Mchombo's (The syntax of Chichewa, Cambridge University Press, 2004) grammars include sufficient examples to get a complete picture of their prosodic properties.

Much dialectal variation exists among the Gumuz but all lects within Ethiopia show evidence of noun incorporation, including that of Gilgel Beles, the focus of this paper. In the past, this noun incorporation in verbs had been overlooked and the verb-noun morpheme pair had been analyzed as one morpheme with infixing inflectional morphology. Thus, verbal ‘roots’ without incorporated nouns had been described as suffixing vs. those with incorporated nouns as infixing verbs (Irwin 1966: 5), or unsplit vs. split (Uzar, Studies in Gumuz: Sese phonology and TMA system, Helmut Buske Verlag, 1989: 371). Upon further investigation, it has become evident that these putative split or infixing verbs do not comprise merely a single root after all. Rather, these verbs have incorporated nouns which create a complex verbal stem. Such incorporated nouns serve many functions in Gumuz and, in some cases, they have grammaticalized as classifiers similar to the process described by Mithun (The convergence of noun classification systems, John Benjamins, 1986:385). To date, no system of predicate classifiers has been documented in the languages of Africa, let alone Ethiopia.

The possessive form of the pronominal subject is the result of the genitive case on the subject assigned by ptcp P, in the absence of a subject agreement projection.

Presenting an analysis along the lines of Cognitive Grammar, we challenge the received interpretation of a verb form with -í in Lingála, as well as of its cognates in other Bantu languages, traditionally taken to mark past tense, notably with dynamic verbs. We claim that the perfect/anterior meaning of this -í form with dynamic verbs should be treated in terms of the cognitive strategies speakers have available for dealing with the “epistemic problem” inherent in observing and reporting nonstative events simultaneously. Accordingly, dynamic verbs taking the -í form should be analyzed together with its use with statives, instead of seeing both types as semantically unrelated. We therefore argue for, and develop, an integrated analysis, which can single-handedly account for both dynamic verbs and stative ones. In schematic terms, we propose that the temporal reference of the -í form, whose aspect is perfect, is present rather than past, even if notions of pastness may be involved in the background conceptualization.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Cross-linguistically, this phenomenon, known as differential object marking (DOM), is most often correlated with the relative definiteness and/or animacy of the object. The divergence among languages in DOM is explained in Optimality Theory by the different ways in which languages resolve the tension between iconicity (favoring marked structures) on the one hand and economy (penalizing marking) on the other hand. Based on a statistical analysis of object marking in a chapter of a contemporary Tigrinya novel, this paper argues that Tigrinya is an example of two-dimensional DOM in which nominal object marking largely correlates with the definiteness and, to a lesser degree, the animacy of the object. The paper also considers the relationship between nominal and verbal object marking.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

By contrast, the “connective particle” -a ‘of’ is consistently marked by animate concords with all human nouns, including human relationship terms. Furthermore, use of Cl. 9–10 concords is limited to contexts where the pronominal possessive immediately follows the Human Relationship Term. This paper explains these facts in semantic and discourse-pragmatic terms, arguing that concord is sensitive to the human relationship term's noun class membership, competition for discourse salience between the human relationship term and the inherently topical pronominal possessive, semantic properties of human relationship terms and the role of the possessive in their interpretation, and the meanings of the associated grammatical morphemes. Where variation between concords exists, concord choice may express differences in affect. The argument is supported by examples from Swahili texts, questionnaire and quantitative data. The historical development of the attested patterns is discussed; some comparison with other Bantu languages is included.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

We show that Luanyjang Dinka has four tonemes, High (H), Low (L), Rising (LH) and Falling (HL). We also describe how underlying tone sequences are often substantially modified in utterances by a number of context-sensitive phonological processes such as dissimilatory lowering of High tones. Given our standard autosegmental description, the phonological categories and processes we posit are broadly familiar from other African languages. However, our analysis requires a typologically less usual understanding of (1) the surface phonetic categories of tone – in particular, what we call “Low” toneme is realized under some conditions as a fairly steep fall; and (2) the relation between the tonal phonology and the quantity system – in particular, we show that each morpheme is underlyingly associated with one and only one toneme, regardless of vowel length. We therefore present a range of acoustic data in support of the basic phonological description.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

To assess these proposals, we engage data from Nigeria's Edoid language Emai. It has verbs with a polysemous structure encompassing posture (‘stand’, ‘sit’, ‘lie’) and continuative state (‘wait’, ‘stay’, ‘sleep’). Important for selecting between contrasting sense assignments are the parameters of spatial and temporal extent. Minimal verb constructions exhibit either posture or continuative state interpretations. Constructions with locative complement, temporal adjunct or verb in series absolutely or partially constrain sense assignment. Asymmetry of sense assignment and of assignment within each sense leads to alternative proposals for the posture verb hierarchy as well as grammaticalization path.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

This paper re-investigates the trigger for palatalization in passive and diminutive formation as well as in environments of juxtaposed vowels. It argues for palatalization being uniformly triggered by a palatal glide. The palatal glide is not necessarily present underlyingly, but may arise through the application of two further phonological processes, namely glide formation and labial dissimilation. Thus, the paper argues against / -iw- / as the underlying passive morpheme as well as against any role by an original *y in the diminutive suffix. Both glide formation and labial dissimilation feed palatalization, so they need to be discussed in conjunction with palatalization in Southern Bantu. New data from the Lobedu dialect of Northern Sotho lend support to the otherwise non-transparent process of labial dissimilation in Southern Bantu.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The system of locative postpositions of Wan comprises two semantic classes which have distinct historical sources: terms referring to intrinsic parts of inanimate objects, and body part terms. I discuss differences in the use and interpretation of locative terms from these two classes. Some of these differences can be explained by different degrees of grammaticalization, in that body part terms are to a lesser extent specialized for expression of abstract spatial relations than object part terms. I illustrate differences in interpretation between body part postpositions and object part postpositions by a pair of nearly synonymous postpositions tā ‘on top of’ and pēŋ ‘at the head of’, which rely in their interpretation on different frames of reference (fixed armatures vs. object-centered, Levinson 2003: 77–79). My analysis is based on the notion of internal asymmetry of the reference object, which allows the body part postpositions to pick out a spatial region in a way that is independent of the object's actual orientation. This example illustrates one way in which the internal asymmetry of the reference object constrains the interpretation of spatial adpositions.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

In this paper we show that Bemba relatives can be marked with a low tone in place of a segmental relative marker. We treat this low tone as a morpheme rather than as just triggering a change in tone pattern that can then be related to relativization. The low tone strategy of relativization, which imposes a restrictive reading of relatives, manifests a phonological phrasing that requires the head noun to be phrased together with the relative clause that it modifies as opposed to non-restrictives where this is not the case. The paper shows that the resultant phonological phrasing favours a head-raising analysis of relativization where the head noun is considered to be inside CP. Despite the syntactic use of the relative tonal morpheme we see that it is also subject to purely phonological constraints that results in its being unable to be used to mark headless relatives. This paper therefore highlights the phonology-syntax connection and shows that phonology can directly inform syntactic analyses.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

However, in contrast to prototypical nominative/accusative systems, it is the nominative case rather than the accusative which receives morphological marking in Datooga. This unusual marking pattern reflects an unusual division of labour between the case forms, the marked nominative being confined to the function of coding S and A in pragmatically neutral clauses, whereas the unmarked “accusative”, or “absolute” as it will be called further on, takes over a wide range of functions apart from coding P, e.g., it characterizes the citation form, nouns in non-verbal predication and preverbal subjects.

Not all phonemes of Kafa I are equally integrated in the phonological system; phonemes with a low frequency are least integrated, and tend to be replaced by phonologically similar phonemes with a higher frequency. Both analyses differ from earlier ones, primarily because some distinctive consonant oppositions postulated earlier turn out to be non-distinctive when quantity is taken care of in a more exact way. Kafa II consonant clusters are shown to constitute strictly defined sets, and most foreign clusters in Kafa I do not differ radically from the native ones.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Until recently, little discussion of the speech sound known as the labial flap has been found in the literature. However, in a series of recent articles, Olson and Hajek have used cross-linguistic evidence to argue for the treatment of the labial flap as a basic speech sound; this has resulted in its recent inclusion in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The present study adds to the discussion by providing an example of a language in which the labial flap is profoundly phonologized. Its distribution in the phonology, morphology and lexicon indicate that in Mambay, the labial flap can be considered nothing other than an integral, contrastive phonological unit.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Further, we argue that only the morphemes -mma and -ss can be considered topic markers while -mm is rather a focus marker. Topics in Amharic are generally marked by fronting the constituent in question to the sentence-initial position. Those which are additionally marked by the morphemes -mm a and -ss are contrastive, i.e., ‘as for’-topics, while topics only marked by fronting are non-contrastive.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

In this paper, I will show that the Lunda construction meets some of the characteristics of a canonical passive and that passivization also serves as one of the tests for transitivity despite the failure of the non-agent to become the subject of the clause.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

It focuses on two processes – fortition and reduplication – in the language and their special relation to ideophones. Fortition involves consonant gemination and lengthening and is used for intensification. Reduplication can be either lexical or grammatical. Ideophones can have an inherent repetitive structure but they can also employ reduplication like other modifiers to signal the plurality of nouns, or the diminutive of verbs. Both fortition and reduplication can occur in the same form, especially in ideophones. It is speculated that fortition could have arisen diachronically in ideophones before spreading to other parts of the language. If this scenario is assumed, it argues for treating ideophones in Leggbo, if not in other languages, as central rather than marginal parts of linguistic systems.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

All of them agree that Urhobo operates a terraced-level tone system with two basic tones (low and high), and two gliding tones (high-low (falling) and low-high (rising)), which are derived from the level tones. They all also recognize the existence of a third pitch, which is found only after the high tone. While Kelly, Elugbe and Aziza regard this pitch as a non-automatic downstep, Welmers regards it as a mid tone.

We use a database of 100 languages, comprising 85 from all Guthrie's groups (A10, A20, etc) plus another 15 from his 15 zones. The most widespread pre-stem markers are: /a/, which comes in several tonal and vowel-length variations, representing ‘past’ in most languages and ‘non-past’ (possibly older focus (Nurse 2006)) in fewer languages; zero ‘general present’; /ka/ ‘itive, narrative, (far) past, (far) future’; /ki/ ‘persistive, participial’; /laa/ ‘future’ and /la/ ‘focus’. The first three certainly go back to Proto-Bantu, the status of the last three is less certain. The commonest suffixes are: /a/ ‘neutral’; /e/ ‘subjunctive’; /ile/ ‘perfect, past’; /ag/ ‘imperfective’; /i/ ‘positive near past’; a vowel copy suffix ‘positive near past’. The first five go back to Proto-Bantu, the sixth is innovation. We propose that /ile, i, the vowel copy suffix/ are connected.

However, many singular nouns have no segmentally distinct suffix, but have a root-final nasal which corresponds to a root-final homorganic plosive in the plural. The plosive is the original alternant, as can be determined on Mabaan-internal grounds as well as by a comparison of Mabaan with other Western Nilotic languages. The nasal alternant of a root-final plosive is a reflex of a former singular suffix with an alveolar nasal. As evidenced by Mayak, another Western Nilotic language, this suffix was an innovation, and it came to be used both in nouns that had no number suffix originally and as an additional suffix in nouns with a singulative suffix. A similar development seems to have taken place in plural nouns, in that a velar plosive suffix is now found in many plural nouns that were presumably morphologically unmarked originally. There is evidence that the new suffixes are Stage III articles. Thus, there are two historical layers of number inflection in Mabaan, a phenomenon somewhat reminiscent of the situation in the Southern Nilotic languages.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

It considers how a full range of grammatical elements are ordered in both kinds of clauses – including direct objects, second objects, particles, weak pronouns, complement clauses, serial verbs, adverbs, prepositional phrases, tense/mood particles, and auxiliary verbs. The pattern that emerges is a bit different from the one found in some superficially similar languages, such as Vata, Bambara, Nupe, and Nweh. I argue that the details are correctly explained by a “remnant movement” theory in which the Lokạạ verb first moves out of the verb phrase to combine with tense/agreement inflection, and then the rest of the verb phrase moves as a unit into a specifier position at the top of the clause. This position is available because the notional subject undergoes dislocation in Lokạạ, as has been claimed for many of its Bantu kin.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

In the variety studied here, nasality is surface-contrastive in vowels but not in consonants. Nasality has the status of a morpheme-level feature which is either present or absent in each morpheme (root or affix). If present, it is predictably distributed across nonobstruent sounds by a system of nasal harmony which operates within the domain of the simple word, spreading nasality bidirectionally until blocked by an obstruent. The class of nasalizing sounds includes the nonexplosive stops ḅ and ’ḅ  , confirming results of an earlier study showing these sounds to be nonobstruents (Clements and Osu 2002). The analysis brings to light some of the basic typological parameters that characterize nasal harmony in Ikwere, as well as an idiosyncratic restriction to the “phonological root”, a domain which excludes initial syllables in noun roots that are homophonous with prefixes in other words. The paper concludes with a summary and discussion of implications for the feature analysis and typology of stops.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Dans cette dernière la voyelle du réduplicatif (la syllabe rédupliquée) est préspécifiée [+HAUT]. Cet article assume qu’il existe une contrainte qui interdit la réduplication de la voyelle du radical monosyllabique et que la position nucléaire du réduplicatif subit le gouvernement par projection nucléaire du noyau de la syllabe du radical verbal (pour acquérir les autres traits). Ce phénomène est bien répandu dans les langues Niger-Congo (cf. Faraclas et Williamson, 1984 ; Capo 1989). This paper deals with the reduplication of monosyllabic verbs in the Kwa languages of Côte d’Ivoire. The study reveals two options: the total reduplication (in which the reduplicated syllable is identical to the radical) and the partial reduplication (in which the vowel of the reduplicated syllable is prespecified [+HIGH]). This phenomenon is well spreaded in Niger-Congo languages (cf. Faraclas and Williamson 1984; Capo 1989). This study claims (for the case of the partial reduplication) there is a constraint on the vowel (of the radical): the reduplication of this vowel is prohibited. In order to acquire the other features, the nucleus of the reduplicated syllable is submitted to the government of the nucleus of the radical (by projection).",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1515/jall.2005.26.1.31,Dmitry Idiatov,"The exceptional morphology of Tura numerals and restrictors: Endoclitics, infixes and pseudowords",2005,"This paper offers a comprehensive account of the exceptional morphosyntactic behaviour of Tura numerals. It explores the ability of the roots of Tura numerals to be split up by the so-called “intensifiers”, or better “restrictors”, which, remarkably, are neither affixes nor clitics in other contexts. This typologically rare phenomenon proves to have interesting implications for morphology, syntax and pragmatics. I claim that some of these constructions result from conventionalization and subsequent univerbation of certain pragmatically marked collocations. The others are a product of reanalysis by analogy that occurred in one specific syntactic environment. The need for an adequate synchronic morphological analysis of the constructions at issue made it necessary to address some theoretical questions, such as endoclisis, word integrity, and constancy of the morphological status of linguistic entities. In most cases when restrictors are used in a numeral-internal position, they are claimed to be infixed roots or infixes. In addition, the notion of “pseudoword(form)” is proposed to account for some of the facts attested. The typologically highly interesting category of restrictors is also examined in detail from syntactic, semantic, etymological and morphological perspectives.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The growth and development of a simplified Swahili variety in the Kenyan battalions of the King's African Rifles (KAR) during the inter-war period was influenced by the European officers' attitude towards Africans and their languages, the military's overarching desire to construct a distinct identity in the colony, and the diverse ethnolinguistic background of African soldiers. While the colonial military provided the ethnographic settings in which the new Swahili variety emerged, it was the African soldiers who were the principal agents in the restructuring and maintenance of KiKAR. The paper further illustrates the structural and lexical simplification of KiKAR based on data contained in KAR's language teaching manual: Newell's (1933) Notes on Ki-Swahili as Spoken by the K.A.R. KiKAR provides a rare glimpse into the outcome of an early contact situation involving diverse African languages and English during Swahili's pre-standardization era.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Problems of classification in Dagbani,2005,"It is widely acknowledged that all languages have a class of adjectives that can be formally or functionally distinguished from other word classes. This article deals with the differences between nouns and adjectives in Dagbani, a Gur language spoken in Ghana. Remarkably, a three-way distinction is required in order to account for the different types. Specifically, Dagbani appears to have two classes whose members can take the functions typically assigned to adjectives. Their major role is to modify a noun, whereas nouns themselves cannot modify each other. The distinction between nouns and adjectives and between the two types of adjectives is based on morphological and syntactic factors: while Type A adjectives behave exactly like canonical nouns from a morphological point of view, Type B resemble loans in that they lack any kind of morphological complexity. However, on the syntactic level, Type B words are more similar to nouns than Type A are. This article investigates the relation between the three different word types and aims at an account of their classification.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Le bedja illustre l'un d'entre eux, celui où c'est le sens d'une construction qui constitue l'élément déclencheur du processus.

This paper claims that the Hausa zâa / zaa -future developed out of a non-continuative form of the verb zâa , which is inherently inchoative and means ‘start to go, be going’. The paper compares the purposive and the future constructions and lays out the grammaticalization stages of the zâa / zaa -future in various dialects of Hausa. Despite its particularity, the Hausa case turns out to be a clear confirmation of the adequacy of the most important grammaticalization concepts in handling variations in a language or across its dialects.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

Using the framework of Dixon (1994), we examine ergative features in Shilluk on the morphological, as well as syntactic, level. Features of morphological ergativity examined include constituent order, constituent marking, pronominal indices, cross-referencing on the verb, the antipassive, and omissibility of arguments. After reviewing these features in independent, non-sequential clauses, we examine them in three types of sequential/dependent clauses. Shilluk proves to be thoroughly ergative in independent clauses, but some ergative features are neutralised in sequential or dependent clauses. The recognition of Shilluk as morphologically ergative is particularly important in light of previous descriptions of the basic ergative sentence as passive. Finally, we consider the ways in which Shilluk is, and is not, syntactically ergative. Although Shilluk is essentially pivotless in coordinate clauses, pronominal reference exhibits minor features of a nominative-accusative system.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics

The origin of this phenomenon has a historical explanation, in this case a stress-shift (from the last-syllable to the penultimate one) of the verb-word (derived from the oxytonic Portuguese infinitive), due to a dominant /'CVCV/ pattern in Badew. Nevertheless, in modern Badew, diachrony does not account for all the verb-noun pairs based on the opposition between mid-open and open vowels. This opposition has become a morphological device that enables Badew to derive new nouns from verbs and vice-versa. Considering the fact that Badew is a Creole language, the appearance of this new derivational system, inexistant in Portuguese, the lexifier language, could have been favored by the necessity of compensating for the failures and ambiguities of a poor vocabulary inherited from the pidgin stage of the language.",Journal of African Languages and Linguistics
