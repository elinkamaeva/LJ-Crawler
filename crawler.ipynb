We explore whether the complementizers are in free variation, as reported in all descriptive and pedagogical work. Our study primarily relies on corpus data, which we supplement with native speaker judgments. We find that the complementizers are not in free variation, but in fact are\\xa0affected by a number of factors known to affect embedded clauses cross-linguistically, including predicate class, person features of the main-clause subject, and mood in the embedded clause. We conclude that the complementizers ultimately reflect subtle, pragmatic factors concerning how the truth of the embedded clause should be evaluated.

'Alimujiang Tusun', 'Uyghur–Chinese early successive adult bilinguals’ construal of caused motion events', 2023, 'Talmy’s motion event typology has served as a fruitful framework for exploring bilingual cognition and language use. The present study extends this line of research to the bilingualism situation of an underrepresented Turkic language, i.e., Modern Uyghur, and Mandarin Chinese, and it does so by focusing on a relatively understudied type of motion, i.e., caused motion. The two languages are genetically and typologically distinct, and yet they share verb-framing as an important lexicalization pattern in encoding motion. This study, therefore, investigated whether and to what extent this structural overlap contributes to crosslinguistic influence in Uyghur–Chinese adult bilinguals’ construal of caused motion. Thirty Uyghur–Chinese adult bilinguals’ verbalizations were analyzed with respect to the number of semantic components expressed and the way they were syntactically packaged. Results were compared with relevant monolingual data, which showed that Uyghur–Chinese adult bilinguals displayed a strong L1 to L2 influence in syntactic packaging by overusing the verb-framed strategy in Mandarin Chinese. However, further comparisons with previous research on Uyghur–Chinese child and adult bilinguals’ motion construal revealed that, while structural overlap is a key factor motivating crosslinguistic influence, a coherent explanation of this phenomenon must consider more general principles of bilingual language processing and use.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2023.8', 'Svetlana Vetchinnikova; Alena Konina; Nitin Williams; Nina Mikušová; Anna Mauranen', 'Chunking up speech in real time: linguistic predictors and cognitive constraints', 2023, 'There have been some suggestions in linguistics and cognitive science that humans process continuous speech by routinely chunking it up into smaller units. The nature of the process is open to debate, which is complicated by the apparent existence of two entirely different chunking processes, both of which seem to be warranted by the limitations of working memory. To overcome them, humans seem to both combine items into larger units for future retrieval (usage-based chunking), and partition incoming streams into temporal groups (perceptual chunking). To determine linguistic properties and cognitive constraints of perceptual chunking, most previous research has employed short-constructed stimuli modeled on written language. In contrast, we presented linguistically naïve listeners with excerpts of natural speech from corpora and collected their intuitive perceptions of chunk boundaries. We then used mixed-effects logistic regression models to find out to what extent pauses, prosody, syntax, chunk duration, and surprisal predict chunk boundary perception. The results showed that all cues were important, suggesting cue degeneracy, but with substantial variation across listeners and speech excerpts. Chunk duration had a strong effect, supporting the cognitive constraint hypothesis. The direction of the surprisal effect supported the distinction between perceptual and usage-based chunking.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2023.12', 'Shujun Chen; Lihuan Wu', 'Variable motion encoding within Chinese: a usage-based perspective', 2023, 'Languages differ considerably in the way they encode motion. Previous research on motion encoding has paid much attention to inter-typological variation (i.e., variation between language types) and intra-typological variation (i.e., variation within language types), but less focus on intra-linguistic variation (i.e., variation within particular languages). To fill this niche, the current study compares actual motion and metaphorical motion in Standard Mandarin Chinese with a corpus-based approach. We ask whether the typological properties in actual motion extend to metaphorical motion. The results indicate that the answer is negative. The typological properties including lexicalization patterns and the distribution of semantic components vary by both event type (actual motion vs. metaphorical motion) and genre (fiction vs. non-fiction) within Chinese. The intra-linguistic variation can be explained by additional factors – the pragmatic context and the structural property of Chinese. These findings support a constructional proposal of the motion event typology, which is a more nuanced typology that expands the binary distinction between V-languages and S-languages. In this proposal, the consideration of the scalar dimension enables more explicit descriptions of variation within languages (shift left- or rightward on the scale) and more accurate explanations for these phenomena.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2023.14', 'Huilan Yang; Giacomo Spinelli; Lingling Li; Stephen J.

(1999) demonstrated facilitatory orthographic neighbor priming for two-character Chinese words (e.g., 华丽–华贵). However, Zhou et al. did not control for relative prime-target frequency, which has been shown to be important in experiments when examining languages with other scripts. In the present Experiment 1 word neighbor primes (e.g., 容易-容貌) produced an inhibitory neighbor priming effect when the prime was higher frequency than the target, paralleling effects in other script languages. In further experiments, paralleling those in other script languages, two-character targets primed by nonword neighbors (容待-容貌) or single constituent characters matching the target in either position (容-容貌) showed significant facilitation.

We found 42 studies matching our criteria, and, in total, 78 effect sizes were included in the meta-analysis. Results showed that individuals with WS have worse lexical-semantic skills than individuals with typical development, whether matched by chronological or mental age. However, people with WS have better lexical-semantic skills than people diagnosed with other cognitive disabilities. Finally, vocabulary skills seem to be relatively spared in WS, although they present some difficulties in semantic processing/integration, semantic memory organisation and verbal working memory skills.

In addition, metaphor change may reveal how conceptualizations of major topics such as economy and ecology evolve over time. After self-building a corpus of China’s 45-year Government Work Reports, this study explores whether there is a difference in attention to topics of economy and ecology over time and investigates the diachronic change of metaphor use on them based on a modified framework for diachronic metaphor change analysis. Results show that attention to economy has been steadily decreasing while attention to ecology has been growing, and that there is an increasing tendency of using more economy and ecology metaphors. Metaphor change on the use of source domains is arranged on a continuum, ranging from constant use (war for economy and ecology, and journey and object for economy), incremental change (living organism and building for economy and ecology, and object for ecology) to fundamental change (building and living organism for ecology).

In two experiments, participants attempted to retain verbal and spatial information from a grid while describing a pattern while gesturing, while making the pattern, or while keeping hands still. Producing gestures reduced verbal load compared to keeping hands still when the pattern being described was visually present (Experiment 1), and this benefit was not shared by making the pattern.

These associations mostly correlate with previous vocal iconicity findings, but crucially, the involved nominal classification devices are mostly semantically typical for non-agreeing, for example, classifier, systems. These findings were attributed to structural differences between nominal classification system types, which result from grammaticalization processes, for example, phonetic erosion and semantic bleaching.

In two visual-world, eye-tracking experiments, we manipulated whether a discourse context biased a spoken target utterance toward a metaphoric or a literal interpretation. We also manipulated the order of verb and object in the target utterances (e.g., Stefan interviewt eine Hyäne, ‘Stefan interviews a hyena’, verb→object; and Stefan wird eine Hyäne interviewen, ‘Stefan will a hyena interview’, object→verb). Experiment 1 shows that contextual cues interacted with sequential order, mediating the processing of verb–object metaphors: When the context biased toward a metaphoric interpretation, participants readily understood the object metaphorically for the verb→object sequence, whereas they likely first understood it literally for the object→verb sequence. Crucially, no such effect of sequential order was found when context biased toward a literal interpretation. Experiment 2 suggests that differences in processing found in Experiment 1 were brought on by the interaction of discourse context and sequential order and not by sequential order alone.

At this very early age, a child’s vocabulary is still relatively small, and this compels them to extend already known words to cope with their increasing communicative needs.

This study focuses on the metonymic relations exploited by 18 Afrikaans-speaking infants and toddlers (between the ages of 0;6 and 2;0) in their early overextensions.

Such pressures may override an initial bias to map reduplicated movement to actions, but nevertheless reflect new iconic mappings shaped by linguistic and cognitive experiences.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2022.21', 'Anouschka Foltz; Beatriz Martín-Gascón; Florencia Paz Silva Marytsch; Javier Olloqui-Redondo; Thora Tenbrink', 'Syntax and object types contribute in different ways to bilinguals’ comprehension of spatial descriptions', 2022, 'The world’s languages draw on different reference frames to encode spatial relationships between people, objects or places.

Results suggest that, in the absence of semantic content, reduplicative forms are inherently associated with several affective meaning associations that are generally considered positive. Two types of reduplicative patterns, namely full reduplication and [i-a]-vowel-alternating reduplication, boost these positive effects to a particularly pronounced degree, leading to an increase in perceived euphony, funniness, familiarity, appreciation, and positive belittling (cuteness) and, at the same time, a decrease in arousal.

Next, we survey time concepts in Yupno, focusing on how topographic concepts are used to construe past, present, and future. We then illustrate how this topographic understanding of time comes to life in the words, hands, and minds of Yupno speakers. Drawing on informal interviews, we offer a view of the topographic system that goes beyond a community-level summary, and offers a glimpse of its individual-level and moment-to-moment texture.

We used the Demonstrative Choice Task (DCT), previously applied to two-term demonstrative languages (Danish, English, and Italian), and applied it to Spanish, a three-term demonstrative system (este/ese/aquel), to test if the semantic dimensions driving demonstrative choice overlap with those found for English. 1,639 native Spanish speakers were presented with 480 nouns rated along 76 semantic features and were asked to match each noun with a demonstrative. We found that demonstratives are influenced by the same semantic factors as two-term languages, such as manipulability, valence, and the self. In Spanish, these semantic factors predict the demonstrative choice between the proximal este/a and a combination of medial and distal forms ese/a and aquel/la. Additional semantic factors affect speakers’ preferences for ese/a versus aquel/a (e.g., visuality and time).

The aim of the present study is to trace how the schematization process unfolds in dense longitudinal data collected from learners in their second semester of intense Norwegian language studies, and to explore the interaction between formulaic and productive patterns in this period of language learning. The analyses show that the learners in general employ a limited repertoire of epistemic verbs, mainly tro ‘think’ and vite ‘know’. The level of productivity of tro and vite constructions varies across the learners: while one learner shows increasingly productive use of constructions with both verbs, other learners rely on semi-fixed construction patterns.

Thirty L2 Chinese learners were first exposed to the target constructions via watching videos, and were then tested for comprehension and production. The results were three-fold: first and foremost, they yielded evidence of syntactic overshadowing of the Ba-construction by its SVO counterpart, resulting in the reduction of the quantity and quality of the Ba production; second, since the form–meaning mapping was successful for both the Ba and SVO construction, the syntactic overshadowing is more likely to be an expression deficit; and third, the pre-knowledge of verbs further confined the use of the Ba-construction, suggesting a moderating role of word entrenchment in L2 syntactic learning.

The effect of language on the production of discourse relations in monologue suggests that LINGUISTIC STRUCTURES can affect speakers’ discourse expectation and production, while the absence of language effect in conversation suggests that this language effect is not due to differences in the way speakers causally relate events or to conceptual or cultural differences in preferences for iconic discourse between English and Korean speakers.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2020.30', 'MARIE HERGET CHRISTENSEN; LINE BURHOLT KRISTENSEN; NICOLINE MUNCK VINTHER; KASPER BOYE', 'Grammar is background in sentence processing', 2021, 'Boye and Harder (2012) claim that the grammatical–lexical distinction has to do with discourse prominence: lexical elements can convey discursively primary (or foreground) information, whereas grammatical elements cannot (outside corrective contexts).

One striking difference has to do with the conflation of sound for action, e.g., creak, squeak, and sound for motion, e.g., slam, crash. This finding supports the received view of English as a language that may lexicalize manner in those kinds of verbs, while Spanish expresses manner through qualifiers outside the verb.

Using a behavioural probe recognition experiment, we show that participants activate elements from another taxonomic category than the focused element as part of sentence comprehension.

When it operates within the VP domain it favors preposition drop in proportion to the number and strength of semantic dependencies between V and P in a given language: the more dependencies there are, and the stronger they are, the stronger the preference for preposition drop. In this way fragments are avoided with long dependencies between P and a distant V. We demonstrate this pattern in English corpora and propose it as an explanation for the typologically unusual preference that English shows for NP fragments. Minimize Forms supports preposition drop in easy-to-process environments cross-linguistically and in English when the more minimal fragment (NP) can be easily linked to its correlate in the antecedent, disfavoring preposition drop elsewhere.

The aim of this task was to assess if the cognition-related meanings of tundma differ from other cognition verbs of Estonian (teadma ‘to know’, aru saama ‘to understand’) in that they are metaphorically linked to physical perception. It was predicted that native speakers use characteristics tied to the physical perception in the conceptualisation of the type of knowledge expressed by tundma.

We analysed Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in different time-windows: (i) early (100–200 and 200–250 ms) to assess differences in processing at the form-level; (ii) the N400 time-window (300–500 ms) in order to establish if there are differences in semantic processing across our word-types; and (iii) late (600–900 ms) to assess post-lexical effects. We found that onomatopoeia differed from the other words in the N400 time-window: when cue and target were unrelated, onomatopoeic words led to greater negativity which can be accounted for in terms of enhanced semantic activation of onomatopoeia which leads to greater salience of the mismatch.

We used a 3D camera (Microsoft Kinect) to capture participants’ gestures and quantify the accuracy with which they reproduce the target gestures in two conditions. In the iconic condition, participants were shown an artificial sign language consisting of congruent gesture–meaning pairs. In the arbitrary condition, the language consisted of non-congruent gesture–meaning pairs. We quantified the accuracy of participants’ gestures using dynamic time warping (Celebi et. al., 2013). Our results show that participants in the iconic condition learn mappings more successfully than participants in the arbitrary condition, but there is no difference in the accuracy with which participants reproduce the forms.

We test the latter alternative by asking signers who differed in ASL proficiency to complete a handshape monitoring task in which we manipulated the number of form–meaning construals that target handshapes participated in.

These patterns suggest that imageability and diagrammaticity interact with proficiency – experts process diagrammatic related distractors phonologically, but novices process them semantically.

Experiment 1 compared iconicity ratings by deaf ASL signers and hearing non-signers for 991 signs from the ASL-LEX database. Signers and non-signers’ ratings were highly correlated; however, the groups provided different iconicity ratings for subclasses of signs: nouns vs. verbs, handling vs. entity, and one- vs. two-handed signs. In Experiment 2, non-signers guessed the meaning of 430 signs and rated them for how transparent their guessed meaning would be for others. Only 10% of guesses were correct. Iconicity ratings correlated with transparency (correct guesses), perceived transparency ratings, and semantic potential (H index).

This means that these overviews included only experimental studies that looked at variations in individual words instead of at the broader logic of messages. For this reason, we conducted a meta-analysis (k = 91, N = 34,783) to compare the persuasive impact of both types of metaphorical frames. Given that patterns of metaphor usage differ across discourse domains, and that effects may differ across modalities and discourse domains, we focused on one mode of presentation and one discourse domain only: verbal metaphorical framing in political discourse. Results showed that, compared to non-metaphorical frames, both metaphorical-words and metaphorical-concepts frames positively influenced beliefs and attitudes.

On one account of implicit causality, remention biases are the product of a combination of a particular lexico-semantic structure with a causal coherence relation. According to a competing account, the biases arise from a perceived lack of information in the discourse, and thus depend on knowledge about the world and the discourse context. To distinguish between the two accounts, it first needs to be established that information that potentially competes with implicit causality, such as relevant information from the discourse context, can reliably influence remention biases. We provide evidence that a violation of implicit assumptions underlying the standard use of implicit causality verbs leads to different inferences, and an alteration of the remention bias.

Forty-four kindergarteners were asked to tell stories after being trained to produce CVPT gestures, gestures from an observer’s viewpoint (OVPT gestures), or after no instruction in gesture. Gestures were coded as CVPT or OVPT, and stories were scored for narrative structure. Children trained to produce CVPT gestures produced more of these gestures, and also had higher narrative structure scores compared to those who received the OVPT training. Children returned for a follow-up session one week later and narrated the stories again. The training received in the first session did not impact narrative structure or recall for the events of the stories.

We consider whether the logic of conditionals is compatible with the socio-cognitive assumptions underlying their interpretation or whether the two come apart. From the classical logical accounts of conditionals, almost all modern theories have inherited a constraint which specifies that a conditional cannot be true if its antecedent is true and consequent false. This logical constraint is widely assumed to constitute, at least partially, a conditional’s semantics, or ‘core meaning’. A replication of Beller et al.’s (2005) study, reported in this paper, calls for revisiting this long-standing, cross-theoretically assumed constraint. As predicted, we have found that, in English, conditional promises are generally consistent with this logical constraint, but threats are not. Our findings provide evidence for the existence of a new usage-based category of conditional threats, and support the claim that the observed logical asymmetry in the interpretation of conditional promises versus threats is just an epiphenomenon of a socio-cognitive symmetry which pertains to people’s assumptions about the deontic commitments of both conditional promisors and threateners.

The ratio of the incidence of intrinsic usage with canonical vs. non-canonical orientation appears to be remarkably uniform across languages, which suggests the possibility of a strong cognitive universal.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2018.13', 'DIRK PIJPOPS; DIRK SPEELMAN; STEFAN GRONDELAERS; FREEK VAN DE VELDE', 'Comparing explanations for the Complexity Principle: evidence from argument realization', 2018, 'The likelihood with which language users insert optional words or morphemes that explicitly mark syntactic structure tends to increase in complex grammatical environments.

Participants listened to sentences with transitive verbs that independently varied whether a male or a female character (1) was mentioned first, (2) was the agent or recipient of an action, and (3) was the grammatical subject or object of the sentence. Replicating previous findings, we show that the first named character as well as the agent of the sentence tends to be drawn to the left in the image, probably reflecting left-to-right reading direction.

In discourse, words are no longer signs but tools covering ephemeral collections of neurosemes: the link of the sign breaks as soon as discourse takes over. The referential potential is no longer the schematic meaning issued from culture, but the universe of discourse under construction. This is why any attempt to account for meaning in language must integrate the neural process of meaning creation. It is now established that meaning is not the result of language activity but the result of cognition. However, what language does, via discourse, is to make this meaning communicable.

We use the method of Multidimensional Scaling to demonstrate this: whatever the exact value of a given aspectual marker, if it is used to mark performatives, then it also commonly features in the expression of states and habits, which have the subinterval property (they can be fully verified based on a random segment), demonstrations, and other special contexts featuring more or less predictable and therefore instantly identifiable events.

Drawing from 740 narratives that depict distortion in the perceived passage of time, I formulate a theory that accounts for the full range of variation in temporal experience. This theory can be represented by an S-shaped figure. According to this theory, variation in the perceived passage of time reflects variation in the density of experience per standard temporal unit. In turn, the density of experience per standard temporal unit is conditioned by the dynamics of social interaction. In its original form, however, this theory assumes that one’s circumstances shape one’s temporal experience in deterministic fashion.

In the data, antonymous lexical items establish experiential dichotomies (e.g., good–bad, guilt–innocence, cause–prevent) that reinforce and specify the nature of evoked contrast. Meaning making in the data, it is proposed, evokes contrastive construal according to bundles of integrated quality dimensions such as modality, morality, and emotion that make up incompatible conceptions of reality.

Engagement systems express the speaker’s assumptions about the degree to which their attention or knowledge is shared (or not shared) by the addressee. Engagement categories can operate at the level of entities in the here-and-now (deixis), in the unfolding discourse (definiteness vs indefiniteness), entire event-depicting propositions (through markers with clausal scope), and even metapropositions (potentially scoping over evidential values). In this first paper, we introduce engagement and situate it with respect to existing work on intersubjectivity in language.

This second paper broadens out to an exploration of engagement at the level of events and even metapropositions, and comments on how such systems may evolve. The languages Andoke and Kogi demonstrate what a canonical system of engagement with clausal scope looks like, symmetrically assigning ‘knowing’ and ‘unknowing’ values to speaker and addressee. Engagement is also found cross-cutting other epistemic categories such as evidentiality, for example where a complex assessment of relative speaker and addressee awareness concerns the source of information rather than the proposition itself. Data from the language Abui reveal that one way in which engagement systems can develop is by upscoping demonstratives, which normally denote entities, to apply at the level of events.

In CR, with the epistemic verbs seem and appear, the matrix-subject functions as a reference-point in relation to the pronominal copy (if a copy exists) in the embedded clause. The aboutness topicality of the matrix-subject in CR is expected, owing to its reference-point property. The epistemic CR construction is acceptable without a pronominal copy if the matrix-subject functions as a reference-point in relation to the complement clause. The same type of analysis is applied to the CR construction with perceptual resemblance (PR) verbs – sound, look, feel, and smell – leading to the conclusion that the strong dichotomy between epistemic and PR verbs is illusory. It is further demonstrated that expletive there-raising in CR is motivated by the same reference-point phenomenon. The difference between there-raising and other CR examples stems from the role of there as a setting subject.

A representative set of visual metaphors and a representative set of linguistic metaphors are here compared, and the semantic similarity between metaphor terms is modeled within the two sets. Such similarity is operationalized in terms of semantic features produced by informants in a property generation task (e.g., McRae et al., 2005). Semantic features provide insights into conceptual content, and play a role in deep conceptual processing, as opposed to shallow linguistic processing. Thus, semantic features appear to be useful for modeling metaphor comprehension, assuming that metaphors are matters of thought rather than simple figures of speech (Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980). The question tackled in this paper is whether semantic features can account for the similarity between metaphor terms of both visual and verbal metaphors. For this purpose, a database of semantic features was collected and then used to analyze fifty visual metaphors and fifty verbal metaphors. It was found that the number of semantic features shared between metaphor terms is predicted by the modality of expression of the metaphor: the terms compared in visual metaphors share semantic features, while the terms compared in verbal metaphors do not.

There are two types of space–motion metaphor of time, distinguished by whether or not the metaphor is structured by a person’s perspective. “Christmas is approaching” and “We are approaching Christmas” are perspectival. “New Year’s follows Christmas” is not. This contrast in deixis and frame of reference is linguistically relevant whether the contrast has to do with imagination or external reality. Study of experiential motivations and analysis into primary metaphors helps reveal the particular ways spatial and motion concepts function in each type of metaphor. One focus is accounting for the contrasting temporal meanings that words for in-front and behind can have. For example, “Ahead of us” is later than Now, while “ahead of Christmas” is earlier than Christmas. We find that the temporal ‘directions’ expressed in the contrasting frames of reference are not opposites. Rather, they are motivated by different kinds of temporal experience. This project investigates the fundamental spatial relations that structure temporal concepts; for example co-location vs. separation. But since motion involves time, purely spatial structure is limited. Conceptual blending analysis reveals that the source and target frames of the perspectival metaphors share an aspectual – i.e., temporal – generic structure. Thus a dichotomy between ‘space’ and ‘time’ is of limited utility in describing space–motion metaphors of time.

This grammar induction algorithm has two goals: first, to show that construction grammars are learnable without highly specified innate structure; second, to develop a model of which units do or do not constitute constructions in a given dataset. The basic task of construction grammar induction is to identify the minimum set of constructions that represents the language in question with maximum descriptive adequacy. These constructions must (1) generalize across an unspecified number of units while (2) containing mixed levels of representation internally (e.g., both item-specific and schematized representations), and (3) allowing for unfilled and partially filled slots. Additionally, these constructions may (4) contain recursive structure within a given slot that needs to be reduced in order to produce a sufficiently schematic representation. In other words, these constructions are multi-length, multi-level, possibly discontinuous co-occurrences which generalize across internal recursive structures. These co-occurrences are modeled using frequency and the ΔP measure of association, expanded in novel ways to cover multi-unit sequences.

Experimental materials consisted of single-sentence novel metaphors whose familiarity, figurativeness, imageability, interpretability, and overall valence ratings were known. Results suggest that beauty and aptness of metaphors are linked for elderly adults but are orthogonal for young adults and literary experts. Elderly participants seem to conflate emotional content with aptness. Young adults are most swayed by a perceived feeling of familiarity when rating for aptness, but not for beauty.

The current study is the first to relate these conditional preferences to online measures of production. For a spoken production task that required speakers to construct sentences based on visual cues, results showed that the same factors that modulate choice of structure – VP length, RC length, and definiteness of the subject NP – also modulate voice initiation time. That is, when the sentential context warrants a particular structure, that structure becomes easier to produce.

When can a construction be extended for use with new words and when can it not? The solution suggested here relies on two complementary processes. The first is dynamic categorization: as learners record the statistics of their language, they implicitly categorize the input on the basis of form and function. On the basis of this categorization process, general semantic and phonological constraints on productivity emerge, and productivity is to a large extent determined by the degree to which the category is well attested by similar exemplars. Occasionally, a semantically sensical and phonologically well-formed instance of a well-attested construction is simply not fully acceptable. It is suggested that a process of statistical preemption is at work in these cases: learners avoid using a construction if an alternative formulation has been systematically witnessed instead. The mechanism proposed for statistical preemption is competition-driven learning: when two competitors are activated but one reliably wins, the loser becomes less accessible over time. In this way, the paradox of partial productivity can be resolved.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2016.18', 'NICK C.

In fact, in some examples, special reduction presages more general sound changes that occur later.

However, statistical learning is not merely learning the patterns presented in the input. When their input is inconsistent, children sharpen these statistics and produce a more systematic language than the one to which they are exposed. When input languages inconsistently violate tendencies that are widespread in human languages, learners shift these languages to be more aligned with language universals, and children do so much more than adults. These processes explain why children acquire language (and other patterns) more effectively than adults, and also may explain how systematic language structures emerge in communities where usages are varied and inconsistent.

We contribute to the cross-linguistic evaluation of the communicative efficiency hypothesis by investigating speakers’ preferences in the production of a typologically rare head-marking alternation that occurs in relative clause constructions in Yucatec Maya. In a sentence recall study, we find that speakers of Yucatec Maya prefer to use reduced forms of relative clause verbs when the relative clause is more contextually expected. This result is consistent with communicative efficiency and thus supports its typological generalizability. We compare two types of cue to the presence of a relative clause, pragmatic cues previously investigated in other languages and a highly predictive morphosyntactic cue specific to Yucatec. We find that Yucatec speakers’ preferences for a reduced verb form are primarily conditioned on the more informative cue.

Through an exploration of the participants’ subjective experiences of time, space, and uncertainty in their recounted OCD episodes, the findings demonstrate that perceptions of threats fluctuate as OCD episodes unfold, and that it is the perceived movement (or not) of the threat that induces distress. Moreover, the dynamism of the threat is conceptualized differently for different subtypes of OCD. This variation can in part be explained by the role of two image schemas in structuring OCD episodes: the SOURCE–PATH–GOAL image schema and the CONTAINER image schema.

Finally, I conclude by arguing that although they share many important insights, the differences of perspective which exist between the integrational and distributed approaches are such as likely to prevent the emergence of anything resembling a unified movement.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2016.1', '', 'LCO volume 8 issue 1 Cover and Front matter', 2016, '//static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS1866980816000016/resource/name/firstPage-S1866980816000016a.jpg', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2016.2', '', 'LCO volume 8 issue 1 Cover and Back matter', 2016, '//static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS1866980816000028/resource/name/firstPage-S1866980816000028a.jpg', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2015.19', 'ELISABETH ZIMA; GEERT BRÔNE', 'Cognitive Linguistics and interactional discourse: time to enter into dialogue', 2015, 'Usage-based theories hold that the sole resource for language users’ linguistic systems is language use (Barlow &amp; Kemmer, 2000; Langacker, 1988; Tomasello, 1999, 2003). Researchers working in the usage-based paradigm, which is often equated with cognitive-functional linguistics (e.g., Ibbotson, 2013, Tomasello, 2003), seem to widely agree that the primary setting for language use is interaction, with spontaneous face-to-face interaction playing a primordial role (e.g., Bybee, 2010; Clark, 1996; Geeraerts &amp; Cuyckens, 2007; Langacker, 2008; Oakley &amp; Hougaard, 2008; Zlatev, 2014). It should, then, follow that usage-based models of language are not only compatible with evidence from communication research but also that they are intrinsically grounded in authentic, multi-party language use in all its diversity and complexities. This should be a logical consequence, as a usage-based understanding of language processing and human sense-making cannot be separated from the study of interaction. However, the overwhelming majority of the literature in Cognitive Linguistics (CL) does not deal with the analysis of dialogic data or with issues of interactional conceptualization. It is our firm belief that this is at odds with the interactional foundation of the usage-based hypothesis. Furthermore, we are convinced that an ‘interactional turn’ is not only essential to the credibility and further development of Cognitive Linguistics as a theory of language and cognition as such. Rather, CL-inspired perspectives on interactional language use may provide insights that other, non-cognitive approaches to discourse and interaction are bound to overlook.

Following through on this view of usage events also means realizing the gradable nature of signs. In addition, taking linguistic meaning as consisting of not only conceptual content but also a particular way of construing that content (Langacker, 2008, p. 43), we find that the forms of expression mentioned above play a prominent role in highlighting the ways in which speakers construe what they are talking about, in terms of different degrees of specificity, focusing, prominence, and perspective.

In this respect, the speaker/writer’s increasing certainty upon the realization of an event or situation is here as factualization.

To do this, we set up a discrimination task in a communication game and manipulated whether the feature dimension shape was relevant or not in discriminating between two referents.

Fixations in agent and action areas of interest were timelocked to utterance onset, and we focused on the pre-articulatory time span to shed light on sentence planning processes, involving message generation and scene conceptualization. Findings are threefold: (i) English speakers mark the status of an event as specific in relation to the action, with progressive aspect marking on the verb in each utterance. German speakers do so by elaborating specific characteristics of the agent; (ii) participants display significantly different gaze allocation patterns to agent and action regions although the sentences produced in both languages follow the same subject−verb word order; and (iii) the analysis of gaze patterns during sentence production given dynamic scenes provide complementary results from a more naturalistic paradigm, to those obtained in studies with still images.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2014.50', '', 'LCO volume 7 issue 1 Cover and Front matter', 2015, '//static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS1866980814000507/resource/name/firstPage-S1866980814000507a.jpg', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2014.49', '', 'LCO volume 7 issue 1 Cover and Back matter', 2015, '//static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS1866980814000490/resource/name/firstPage-S1866980814000490a.jpg', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2014.4', 'YINGLIN JI; JILL HOHENSTEIN', 'The expression of caused motion by adult Chinese learners of English*', 2014, 'Although spatial understanding by human beings tends to be universal, the linguistic system to represent one’s spatial experience varies significantly across languages.

On the grammatical functions of the Estonian välja ‘out’', 2013, \"Among the typologically agglutinative Finno-Ugric languages, Estonian is in many ways exceptional since it has developed a long way towards the analytic type. One indicator of this is the extensive use of particles and adverbs to indicate grammatical relations such as aspect. Our paper discusses, in a Cognitive Grammar framework, the grammatical functions of the adverb välja ‘out’, which is originally an illative (‘into’) case form of the lexical noun väli ‘field’. Our study shows how the meanings evolve along a continuum from concrete senses to more abstract ones, and we set out to find motivations for the development. The form välja has developed numerous usages as an adverb and a verb particle. Its concrete spatial meaning is that of indicating a relation where a mover exits a (typically three-dimensional) container and moves from its inside to its outside. The abstract functions of this multi-functional gram include the following ones: 1) a change in the cognitive state of an animate participant (e.g., as the result of acquiring information), 2) changes-of-state metaphorically represented as motion out of a container, 3) terminative direction or distance (‘all the way to X’) and 4) perfective aspect. We argue that a crucial factor in the development of these functions is the placement of the conceptualizer's viewpoint either inside or outside the container which the mover exits. A viewpoint outside the container means that in the initial configuration the mover is hidden from the conceptualizer's view, and when exiting the container it becomes accessible to the conceptualizer. This meaning motivates abstract functions where välja indicates incipient availability or accessibility of the mover. On the other hand, a viewpoint situated inside the container results in the meaning where the mover (that exits the container) escapes from the conceptualizer's view, or, in abstract expressions, its cognitive dominion. This motivates the use of the gram in many expressions of a change of state, and in particular builds a link to its aspectual functions where it indicates the spatiotemporal extent of an event or an entity by measuring the distance from the starting point of such (concrete or metaphorical) motion.\", 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1515/langcog-2013-0024', 'Nira Mashal', 'The role of working memory in the comprehension of unfamiliar and familiar metaphors', 2013, 'Comprehension of unfamiliar metaphors (mercy blanket) is an effortful cognitive process that requires the formation of a novel metaphoric mapping between two disparate domains during which irrelevant properties have to be suppressed.

Results of the second experiment revealed that unfamiliar metaphors induced a higher rate of semantic errors relative to phonological errors, whereas familiar metaphors induced the same number of phonological and semantic errors.

Here I describe findings about established and emerging sign languages that bear specifically upon the interaction between sign and speech proposed in the Mirror System Hypothesis. While supporting the central role that Arbib attributes to gestural/visual communication in understanding language and its evolution, I point out some kinks in the spiral that potentially disrupt its smooth expansion. One is the fact that each modality relies on an entirely different motor system. Another is the type of relation that holds between the articulators and grammatical structure, which is radically different in each system as well. A third kink disrupts the proposed continuity between holistic pantomime (gestural holophrases) and signs. Given such differences, instead of a scenario in which speech grew out of sign, it seems more likely that the two modalities complemented each other symbiotically throughout evolution as they do today.

Damage to Broca's area (or to the mirror system for human action) does not result in deficits in sign or speech perception. Second, the gesticulations of speakers are highly integrated with speech, but pantomimes and modern protosigns (conventional gestures) are not co-expressive with speech, and they do not co-occur with speech. Further, signers also produce global, imagistic gesticulations with their mouths and bodies simultaneously while signing with their hands.

It is argued that demonstratives provide an important link between gesture, discourse, and grammar that rests on their communicative function to coordinate the interlocutors' focus of attention. Combining evidence from linguistic typology and historical linguistics with evidence from research on social cognition, the paper argues that demonstratives constitute a universal class of linguistic expressions that are commonly used in combination with a deictic pointing gesture to establish joint attention, a cognitive phenomenon that is closely related to Arbib's notion of “complex imitation”. No other class of linguistic expressions is so closely tied to the speaker's body and gesture than demonstratives. However, demonstratives are not only used to focus the language users' attention on concrete entities in the surrounding situation, they are also used to organize the information flow in discourse, which in turn underlies their frequent development into a wide range of grammatical markers, e.g. definite articles, third person pronouns, relative markers, complementizers, subordinate conjunctions, copulas, and focus markers.

The intimate link between praxic action and symbolic action is present not only in the human brain, but also in the human biocultural complex. The confluence of praxis and symbolization has, in the time scale of sociogenesis, potentiated the invention of domain-constituting and cognition-altering symbolic cognitive artefacts that continue to transform human socio-cultural ecologies.

We found that 3-year-old Mandarin speakers were above chance in their classifier knowledge, but this knowledge continued to develop through 7 years of age. We also found that Mandarin speakers relied more heavily on shape than English speakers, and that shape-based categorization among English speakers tended to decline with age on the trials in which shape choices matched the Mandarin classifiers.

The explanation centers on a process involving metaphorical transfer, the loss of semantic features, generalization, and a specific syntactic context conducive to this meaning shift. First, the Mind-as-Body metaphor is applied to the mind-related notion of ‘seeing an object’ to derive the body-related notion of ‘controlling an object’, as has previously been demonstrated to be the case in the history of certain Indo-European languages. Second, semantic bleaching causes the meaning component of physical sight to be lost from the overall meaning of the morpheme, and semantic generalization allows attempted actions to be mentally treated the same as physical objects that are manipulated.

Roughly speaking, DoP refers to the fact that the meaningful units of language – words or morphemes – are made up of meaningless units – phonemes or features – whose only function is to distinguish the meaningful units from one another. Stated this way, the idea seems quite straightforward, and to have it explicitly stated as a property of language seems a useful insight. In fact, though, of all the design features discussed by Hockett, DoP seems to have engendered the most confusion.

However, an alternative interpretation, explored in this article, is that duality, like other proposed linguistic universals, is a statistical tendency reflecting a complex set of factors, and most centrally, the need for some minimal number of basic units that can recombine to yield a potentially infinite set of form-meaning correspondences. If this is the essence of duality, then we expect: languages where duality is not a central component of grammar; languages where most, but not all, utterances are decomposable into meaningless phonological units; and different types of phonological building blocks in different languages.

The first is that DP is a necessary solution to the problem of conveying a large number of meanings; the second is that DP arises as a consequence of conventionalization. We tested these hypotheses in an experimental-semiotics study.

I review evidence for these properties and argue that they interact to provide a pathway for individual usage events to influence the evolution of contrastive sublexcal category systems, i.e phoneme inventories. Specifically, the proposed Network-Feedback model predicts that the organization of sublexical category systems is shaped by a conflict between a general drive toward greater similarity among sublexical categories on the one hand, and a bias toward maintaining contrast between tokens of competing lexical categories on the other. The model provides testable hypotheses about the conditions favoring phoneme merger, chain-shifts, and phonemic splits, and more generally about the influence of lexical contrast on the packing of sublexical categories along gestural/perceptual dimensions.

Participants learn and recall a system of sounds that are produced with a slide whistle.

In an effort to explore where combinatorial structure of meaningless elements arises the results of two pilot experiments are presented within which we observe human participants modifying a small lexicon of visual symbols through a process of iterated learning.

I argue that these features are a consequence of spontaneous emergence of combinatorial, sub-lexical structure in the lexicon, that the pattern of emergence is more complex than the most widely espoused explanation suggests, and I propose ways in which future work can build on what we learn from these pilot experiments to confirm this hypothesis.\", 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/S1866980800000673', '', 'LCO volume 4 issue 4 Cover and Front matter', 2012, '//static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS1866980800000673/resource/name/firstPage-S1866980800000673a.jpg', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1017/S1866980800001150', '', 'LCO volume 4 issue 4 Cover and Back matter', 2012, '//static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn%3Acambridge.org%3Aid%3Aarticle%3AS1866980800001150/resource/name/firstPage-S1866980800001150a.jpg', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1515/langcog-2012-0009', 'Jeannette M.

In addition, the inclusion of Spanish monolinguals living in the Bora village allowed control for the possibility that differences found between English and Bora speakers may be attributed to their very different living environments.

In 39 dyads, addressees were either attentive when speakers told a joke or else distracted by a second task, while speakers expected addressees to be either attentive or distracted. Independently of adjustments in speech, both speakers' expectations and addressees' feedback shaped quantitative and qualitative aspects of gesturing. Speakers gestured more frequently when their prior expectations matched addressees' actual behavior. Moreover, speakers with attentive addressees gestured more in the periphery of gesture space when they expected addressees to be attentive. These systematic adjustments in gesturing suggest that speakers flexibly adapt to their addressees by integrating bottom-up cues available during the interaction in light of attributions made from top-down expectations.

Rather, they constitute an initial classification for finding a conceptually grounded explanation of it. The hypothesis is put forward that mood choice in factive contexts can be explained by the elaboration of Maldonado's (1995) notions of dominion and control. On the one hand, the conceptualizer has a low degree of effective control over the described event in presupposed contexts where the subjunctive mood occurs. On the other hand, presupposed contexts with the verb in the indicative mood equates with epistemic control over the described event. Thus, it is argued that the meaning of the subjunctive mood is related to the conceptualizer's epistemic dominion, and to the dominion of effective control.

Force imagery both in ordinary action descriptions and in metaphor opens a vista on how readers infer, stabilize, and elaborate narrative macro-representations of “who wants what” and “who does what to whom?” Hence, texts subtly encode aspects of higher-level story logic through forces, enabling readers (and scholars) to detect and scale up coherence patterns that shed light on character motives, protagonist interaction, and plot dynamics.

In two experiments, properties bearing a linguistic relation to the word for a concept were produced earlier than properties not bearing a linguistic relation, suggesting the early properties tend to originate in a word association process. Conversely, properties produced later tended to describe objects and situations, suggesting that late properties tend to originate from describing situated simulations. A companion neuroimaging experiment reported elsewhere confirms that early properties originate in language areas, whereas later properties originate in situated simulation areas. Together, these results, along with other results in the literature, indicate that property generation is a relatively complex process, drawing on at least two systems somewhat asynchronously.', 'Language and Cognition'], ['https://doi.org/10.1515/langcog.2011.005', 'Christopher D.

Following the implications of the geometrical structure logic of DST, epistemic concepts are taken as fundamental and as presupposed in deontic meanings. It is argued that counterfactuality, which can be modelled as a geometrical reflection transformation, is crucial to the modelling of the conceptual space of obligation concepts expressed in English modal verbs. It is further argued that a second-order reflection transformation can model permission concepts. Deontic ‘force’ is modelled in a natural way as force vectors, an already assumed ingredient of DST's geometrical framework.

Here, with a focus on spatial thought and language, I review some of the evidence cited in support of simulation versions of embodied cognition accounts. While these data are extremely interesting and many of the experiments are elegant, knowing how to best interpret the results is often far from clear.

In my view, the question of whether or not cognition is grounded is more fruitfully replaced by questions about gradations in this grounding. A focus on disembodying cognition, or on graded grounding, opens the way to think about how humans abstract. Within neuroscience, I propose that three functional anatomic axes help frame questions about the graded nature of grounded cognition. First, are questions of laterality differences. Do association cortices in both hemispheres instantiate the same kind of sensory or motor information? Second, are questions about ventral dorsal axes. Do neuronal ensembles along this axis shift from conceptual representations of objects to the relationships between objects?

Here, we present evidence that acoustic features of spontaneous speech reflect these probabilities: when speakers choose a less probable construction, they are more likely to be disfluent, and their fluent words are likely to have a relatively longer duration.

The Normal response key was either on the left of a response box or on the right. The named objects were themselves either on the left or the right of the response box. We demonstrate a compatibility effect in which responding Normal to the side where the object was located was faster than responding Normal to the opposite side. Furthermore, this effect was equally strong for sentences describing states of the objects (as above) and sentences describing actions (e.g., “Touch the apple at the stem”); the compatibility effect was found when the objects were removed; the effect required compatibility between actions, not just spatial locations; and the effect was found in both English and German.

The present article offers a detailed comparison of OE target noun phrases containing postnominal adjectives with their Latin counterparts to determine the exact extent to which this arrangement may have been a syntactic calque from a foreign language. The study has found that while a fair number of OE postposed adjectives did copy their Latin originals, their placement could be accounted for through reference to tendencies characteristic of OE (i.e. the adjective displays different degrees of “verbalness” or is part of a heavy phrase).

Acculturation, the process by which an individual integrates their native values and behaviours with those of the host culture, is an integral part of this process. It has been suggested that the choice of acculturation strategy can either facilitate or hinder L2 acquisition (Schumann, 1986; Berry, 1997). Pronunciation is a vital aspect of L2 proficiency and is often seen as mediating an individual's identity in the host culture (Piske et al., 2001). This study focuses on the pronunciation patterns of ten adult Polish immigrants living in Welshpool, Wales, and attempts to examine the potential relationship between a chosen acculturation strategy (adaptation or preservation) and the use of rhoticity in English. Rhoticity, a salient feature of British English pronunciation that varies in use and quality depending on the region (Wells, 1982), has been previously studied in relation to the use of rhoticity by Polish speakers (Jaworski, 2010; Jaworski & Gillian, 2011; Stolarski, 2013, 2015; Zając, 2016; Rojczyk & Zając, 2017; Matysiak, 2020), with a notable emphasis on the use of taps in intervocalic and post-vocalic positions.

The course content included presentation of direct links between language and music, and of selected studies indicating the influence of music on developing various aspects of linguistic performance, e.g. second language learning (e.g. Pastuszek-Lipińska, 2008; Kolinsky et al., 2009), early reading abilities (Fonseca-Mora et al., 2018) or pitch processing (Besson et al., 2007). The practical part of the course involved testing the students' musical abilities with the use of various tools: tests available online and a sample of a music school entrance exam (based on Rybińska et al., 2016). The participants completed tasks related to their English speech performance, i.e. recording the passage The North Wind and the Sun and analysing their English speech production with the use of acoustic speech analysis software (Praat) in order to learn about the ways in which they could explore the possible links between their musicality and performance in L2 English.

While there are numerous advantages of using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in foreign language teaching, some Polish lexicographers insist on, what they call, a “simplified” phonetic transcription. In my paper I conduct an overview of three English-Polish dictionaries which use orthographic transcription instead of the IPA and exemplify inevitable confusion and serious problems they present the learner with. The analysis reveals that orthographic transcription intensifies interference between L1 and L2 and contributes to the fossilization of the most persistent mispronunciations stemming from phonetic transfer. Inconsistent and inaccurate transcription prevents learners from spotting patterns and rules (such as e.g. non-rhoticity, vowel reduction, silent letters, etc.). It is argued that relying on ordinary spelling rather than the IPA is a short-sighted alternative which presents more problems than solutions.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.18778/1731-7533.20.2.03',\n","  'Łukasz Stolarski ',\n","  'Correlations Between Positive or Negative Utterances and Basic Acoustic Features of Voice: a Preliminary Analysis',\n","  2022,\n","  'The major aim of this paper is to establish possible correlations between continuous sentiment scores and four basic acoustic characteristics of voice.

All participants had one trial at the beginning of the experiment to familiarise themselves with the tool and they all read and recorded the words and phrases as they appeared on the screen. The first group only had access to this text (no input) before recording their own productions whereas the other 3 groups received supplementary input. Group 2 read the text and heard the corresponding audio (audio input), group 3 read the text and saw the corresponding 3D spectrogram (visual input) and group 4 read the text, heard the audio and saw the corresponding 3D spectrogram (multi-sensorial input). An auditive analysis leads us to believe that both hearing speech and seeing the corresponding spectrogram is beneficial, especially for intonation.

Inter-rater reliability analysis showed a moderate level of agreement for all raters and a good level of agreement upon eliminating feedback from Reading Progress. Meanwhile, the qualitative analysis revealed certain problems, notably false positives, i.e., words pronounced within the boundaries of academic pronunciation standards, but still marked as incorrect by the digital rater. We recommend that EFL teachers and researchers approach the current version of Reading Progress with caution, especially as regards automated feedback. However, its design may still be useful for manual feedback.

The main aim of this study does not aim to classify L2 pronunciation methods by allocating them to previously mentioned categories but rather attempts to examine the intricate relationship between students’ knowledge, perceptions, attitudes and their most preferable practices which, in their opinion, result in improvement of their L2 pronunciation. 118 study subjects were asked to complete four main questions, within which tasks based on the Likert-scale items gathered data about the students’ most preferable L2 pronunciation teaching and learning techniques. The students were asked to create their own list, starting from the most useful to the least beneficial techniques. The last task was an open-ended question about other techniques than mentioned in the questionnaire. The analysis of the obtained data involved a two-stage process: a) data segmentation; and b) techniques categorisation. The first step was to select pronunciation learning techniques in terms of their frequency and use and to adjust them to the research group. The second stage, techniques categorisation, was based on a careful analysis of the answers given by the students in the questionnaire. Following that, five categories were distinguished: (1) traditional and used only in the classroom, (2) traditional but also used in distance learning, (3) computer-assisted but used only in the classroom, (4) computer-assisted and also used in distance learning, (5) innovative: combining students’ needs and available online.Highlighting the prominence of pronunciation in acquiring communicative competence, the authors propose their own, innovative suggestions for the future creation of teaching materials.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.18778/1731-7533.20.1.01',\n","  'Anna Jarosz ; Iwona Witczak-Plisiecka ',\n","  'Native and Non-Native Accents of English: Different Perceptions of English as a Global Language in a Phonetic Perspective.

Considering that English allows unreleased plosives before any stop, that is in a wider range of contexts than Polish, a Polish learner may find it confusing that it is regarded unacceptable to block the affricate release before another (in English always homorganic) affricate. In Polish the first of two homorganic affricates is often reduced to the occlusion phase, while unreleased plosives appear very rarely in non-homorganic contexts. This apparent paradox in the treatment of affricate and plosive consonant clusters may lead to complicated transfer patterns, which we examine by observing the release suppression tendencies in Polish and English phrases and sentences read by phonetically trained and untrained Polish learners of English. The results indicate strong negative transfer tendencies and suggest a connection between gemination patterns and unreleased occlusive distribution in a language.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.18778/1731-7533.19.1.02',\n","  'Martin Janečka',\n","  'Exploring Communicative Gestures in Czech Persons with Diagnosed Aphasia',\n","  2021,\n","  'In my investigation, I worked with 6 persons with diagnosed aphasia.

The future of such texts may also lie in the emerging future reading - “distant reading” to quote Walkowitz` use of Moretti`s term.

It has been observed that, in view of the differences between Polish and English word order, university students at the start of their translator training experience two general problems as they attempt to translate longer stretches of text into English: (1) they produce cohesive passages, which contain errors in word order (due to syntactic interference from Polish) or (2) they produce grammatically correct sentences, which, however, form incohesive passages (i.e. ones in which the thematic/rhematic progression is not retained) with an inappropriate information structure.

The results point to the influential role of both L2LoP and L3LoP as well as their interaction on the production of the L3 Spanish sibilant. When the level of proficiency in one of the languages was low, it allowed the other language with a higher level of proficiency to exert influence on the values of the spectral moments in the L3 sibilant.

Segmental (vowel quality), suprasegmental (vowel duration) and voice quality were analysed. Level of proficiency, gender and model talker were taken as independent variables. Level appeared not to be a relevant parameter due to a high amount of inter-individual variability amongst groups. Somewhat contradictory results were observed for vowel duration and F1-F2 distance for male learners converged more than female learners. Our hypothesis that low vowels display a higher degree of imitation, and especially within the F1 dimension (Babel, 2012), was partially validated. Convergence in vowel duration in order to sound more native-like was also observed (Zając, 2013). Regarding the analysis of voice quality, and more particularly of creaky voice, observations suggest that some advanced female learners creaked more than the native speakers and more in the reading task, which indicate, both linguistic idiosyncrasy and accommodation towards the native speakers.

An Evaluation on the Accentedness of Segmental/Syllable Errors in L2 Speech',\n","  2018,\n","  'Many English language instructors are reluctant to incorporate pronunciation instruction into their teaching curriculum (Thomson 2014). One reason for such reluctance is that L2 pronunciation errors are numerous, and there is not enough time for teachers to address all of them (Munro and Derwing 2006; Thomson 2014). The current study aims to help language teachers set priorities for their instruction by identifying the segmental and structural aspects of pronunciation that are most foreign-accented to native speakers of American English. The current study employed a perception experiment. 100 speech samples selected from the Speech Accent Archive (Weinberger 2016) were presented to 110 native American English listeners who listened to and rated the foreign accentedness of each sample on a 9-point rating scale. 20 of these samples portray no segmental or syllable structure L2 errors. The other 80 samples contain a single consonant, vowel, or syllable structure L2 error. The backgrounds of the speakers of these samples came from 52 different native languages. Global prosody of each sample was controlled for by comparing its F0 contour and duration to a native English sample using the Dynamic Time Warping method (Giorgino 2009). The results show that 1) L2 consonant errors in general are judged to be more accented than vowel or syllable structure errors; 2) phonological environment affects accent perception, 3) occurrences of non-English consonants always lead to higher accentedness ratings; 4) among L2 syllable errors, vowel epenthesis is judged to be as accented as consonant substitutions, while deletion is judged to be less accented or not accented at all. The current study, therefore, recommends that language instructors attend to consonant errors in L2 speech while taking into consideration their respective phonological environments.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.2478/rela-2018-0008',\n","  'Monika Konert-Panek',\n","  'Singing Accent Americanisation in the Light of Frequency Effects: LOT Unrounding and PRICE Monophthongisation in Focus',\n","  2018,\n","  'The paper investigates – within the framework of usage-based phonology – the significance of lexical frequency effects in singing accent Americanisation.

The modality notions with ideational and interpersonal functions are content and person-oriented, respectively. While all dynamic modal notions are characterized by objectivity, deontic and epistemic modal notions may display a degree of (inter)subjectivity depending on their embedding context. Our main claim is that (inter)subjectivity can hardly be argued to be the inherent property of certain modality forms and types, but rather it is essentially a contextual effect. We functionally-operationally define (inter)subjectivity as the degree of sharedness an evaluator attributes to an epistemic/deontic evaluation and its related evidence/deontic source. (Inter)subjectivity is realized by (at least) one or a combination of three contextual factors, viz. the embedding syntactic pattern, the linguistic context and the extralinguistic context of a modality marker. Since both descriptive and performative modal evaluations involve a degree of (inter)subjectivity, performativity, which refers to speaker’s current commitment to his evaluation, is viewed as an independent dimension within modal evaluations and plays no part in the expression of (inter)subjectivity.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.2478/rela-2018-0004',\n","  'Hannah N.

Versions of conceptual metaphor theory have been applied in various productoriented studies of how translators deal with the challenge of metaphor in translation. However, there is potential in combining product-oriented approaches with techniques used to access translators’ cognitive processes, although process-oriented studies on how conceptual metaphor is re-conceptualised or re-mapped in translation are still rare. Building on an exploratory study carried out at our institute, in which findings from translation process data suggest that experience and/or training appears to be a main factor in handling conceptual metaphor, we present some salient features of re-mapping metaphor. Triangulating data from target-text products, keystroke logs and retrospective verbal commentaries collected under very similar conditions in a laboratory setting, we analyse how translators at different levels of experience handle two complex conceptual metaphors. The results appear to suggest that complex metaphor might indeed be culturespecific. They also potentially indicate that re-mapping practices are a function of experience and that re-mapping to a source-language target domain could create more uncertainty than generic-level re-mapping.

Against this background, I propose a model of translation processing focused on the internal simulation of reader reception and the calibration of these simulations to achieve similarity between ST and TT impact. The concept of cognitive equivalence is exemplarily tested by exploring a conceptual / lexical field (MALE BALDNESS) through the way that English, German and Japanese lexical items in this field are linked to matching visual-conceptual representations by native speaker informants. The visual data gathered via this empirical method can be used to effectively triangulate the linguistic items involved, enabling an extra-linguistic comparison across languages. Results show that there is a reassuring level of inter-informant agreement within languages, but that the conceptual domain for BALDNESS is linguistically structured in systematically different ways across languages.

Rhoticity, a salient feature of British English pronunciation that varies in use and quality depending on the region (Wells, 1982), has been previously studied in relation to the use of rhoticity by Polish speakers (Jaworski, 2010; Jaworski & Gillian, 2011; Stolarski, 2013, 2015; Zając, 2016; Rojczyk & Zając, 2017; Matysiak, 2020), with a notable emphasis on the use of taps in intervocalic and post-vocalic positions. The present study found some inconsistencies in the use of rhoticity in English.\",\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.18778/1731-7533.20.3.02',\n","  'Anna Gralińska-Brawata',\n","  'Language and Music: Designing a Course at an Academic Level',\n","  2022,\n","  \"The parallels that are present between language and music, together with popular beliefs that musicality may be a factor enhancing language learning, especially with regard to pronunciation, prompted the idea of designing an academic course whose main aim was to demonstrate the relation between the two domains from the linguistic perspective.

The course content included presentation of direct links between language and music, and of selected studies indicating the influence of music on developing various aspects of linguistic performance, e.g. second language learning (e.g. Pastuszek-Lipińska, 2008; Kolinsky et al., 2009), early reading abilities (Fonseca-Mora et al., 2018) or pitch processing (Besson et al., 2007). The practical part of the course involved testing the students' musical abilities with the use of various tools: tests available online and a sample of a music school entrance exam (based on Rybińska et al., 2016). The participants completed tasks related to their English speech performance, i.e. recording the passage The North Wind and the Sun and analysing their English speech production with the use of acoustic speech analysis software (Praat) in order to learn about the ways in which they could explore the possible links between their musicality and performance in L2 English. The majority of students claimed that they had not been aware of the degree of interplay between language and music, and had overestimated their musical abilities prior to taking the tests, but they saw the potential of music training not only in language learning, but other spheres of human activity.\",\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.18778/1731-7533.20.3.03',\n","  'Maria Szymańska',\n","  'Gendered Neologisms Beyond Social Media: the Current Use of \"Mansplaining\"',\n","  2022,\n","  'The word mansplaining, which is a linguistic blend of man and explaining, is one of the examples of a trend in the English language of creating gendered neologisms – blends and compounds that add an aspect of gender to the meaning of already existing words that originally are gender-neutral (or appear to be).

While there are numerous advantages of using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in foreign language teaching, some Polish lexicographers insist on, what they call, a “simplified” phonetic transcription. In my paper I conduct an overview of three English-Polish dictionaries which use orthographic transcription instead of the IPA and exemplify inevitable confusion and serious problems they present the learner with. The analysis reveals that orthographic transcription intensifies interference between L1 and L2 and contributes to the fossilization of the most persistent mispronunciations stemming from phonetic transfer. Inconsistent and inaccurate transcription prevents learners from spotting patterns and rules (such as e.g. non-rhoticity, vowel reduction, silent letters, etc.).

In Polish the first of two homorganic affricates is often reduced to the occlusion phase, while unreleased plosives appear very rarely in non-homorganic contexts. This apparent paradox in the treatment of affricate and plosive consonant clusters may lead to complicated transfer patterns, which we examine by observing the release suppression tendencies in Polish and English phrases and sentences read by phonetically trained and untrained Polish learners of English.

In this connection, we account for our main assumption that translation teaching should be based on a sound theoretical footing that takes the conceptual system and the frames, or other structuring entities, populating it on board. Experimentally focusing on the conceptual system, cognitive linguistics’ framework, we contend building on some relevant literature, provides a wide range of far reaching procedural models conductive to the innovation of translation pedagogy and practice.

Translated versions of literary texts that were created and received within local cultural contexts, when translated, enter new, foreign contexts. When translations into many other languages appear, a writer may expect many diverse valuations of one`s work. Literary texts in translation, in fact, are an inseparable from literary experiences for many readers and the study of translated texts has a long-standing tradition. The future of such texts may also lie in the emerging future reading - “distant reading” to quote Walkowitz` use of Moretti`s term. Among the strongest arguments in support of such reading is the possibility, through translated texts, to establish a more aesthetic distance towards the object of a fictional text in translation. Translation gives us as readers a new and different approach towards objects we fail to notice because of their familiarity. Nature scenes and objects may be included among such features of the narrative that could be more aesthetically appreciated in the translated versions.

These aspects have implications for translation teaching. It has been observed that, in view of the differences between Polish and English word order, university students at the start of their translator training experience two general problems as they attempt to translate longer stretches of text into English: (1) they produce cohesive passages, which contain errors in word order (due to syntactic interference from Polish) or (2) they produce grammatically correct sentences, which, however, form incohesive passages (i.e. ones in which the thematic/rhematic progression is not retained) with an inappropriate information structure. For this reason, students need to become acquainted with some practical solutions that help build cohesion in Polish-English translation. These include (1) shifts from active to passive, (2) other shifts in syntactic functions, (3) fronting, and (4) inventing sentence subjects out of broader context.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.18778/1731-7533.18.1.01',\n","  'Guntars Dreijers; Valda Rudziša',\n","  'Devices of Textual Illusion: Victimization in Romance Scam E-Letters',\n","  2020,\n","  'Virtual communication transcends national boundaries and allows establishing and maintaining contacts efficiently.

While most studies analysing this process have been conducted amongst speakers sharing the same language or variety, this experiment focuses on imitation between non-native and native speakers in a repetition task. The data is a fragment from the ANGLISH corpus designed by Anne Tortel (Tortel, 2008). 40 French speakers (10 male intermediate, 10 male advanced, 10 female intermediate and 10 female advanced learners) were asked to repeat a set of 20 sentences produced by British native speakers. Segmental (vowel quality), suprasegmental (vowel duration) and voice quality were analysed. Level of proficiency, gender and model talker were taken as independent variables. Level appeared not to be a relevant parameter due to a high amount of inter-individual variability amongst groups. Somewhat contradictory results were observed for vowel duration and F1-F2 distance for male learners converged more than female learners. Our hypothesis that low vowels display a higher degree of imitation, and especially within the F1 dimension (Babel, 2012), was partially validated. Convergence in vowel duration in order to sound more native-like was also observed (Zając, 2013). Regarding the analysis of voice quality, and more particularly of creaky voice, observations suggest that some advanced female learners creaked more than the native speakers and more in the reading task, which indicate, both linguistic idiosyncrasy and accommodation towards the native speakers. Low vowels seem also to be more likely to be produced with a creaky voice, especially at the end of prosodic constituents.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.2478/rela-2018-0020',\n","  'Rias van den Doel; Anne-France C.

One reason for such reluctance is that L2 pronunciation errors are numerous, and there is not enough time for teachers to address all of them (Munro and Derwing 2006; Thomson 2014). The current study aims to help language teachers set priorities for their instruction by identifying the segmental and structural aspects of pronunciation that are most foreign-accented to native speakers of American English. The current study employed a perception experiment. 100 speech samples selected from the Speech Accent Archive (Weinberger 2016) were presented to 110 native American English listeners who listened to and rated the foreign accentedness of each sample on a 9-point rating scale. 20 of these samples portray no segmental or syllable structure L2 errors. The other 80 samples contain a single consonant, vowel, or syllable structure L2 error. The backgrounds of the speakers of these samples came from 52 different native languages. Global prosody of each sample was controlled for by comparing its F0 contour and duration to a native English sample using the Dynamic Time Warping method (Giorgino 2009). The results show that 1) L2 consonant errors in general are judged to be more accented than vowel or syllable structure errors; 2) phonological environment affects accent perception, 3) occurrences of non-English consonants always lead to higher accentedness ratings; 4) among L2 syllable errors, vowel epenthesis is judged to be as accented as consonant substitutions, while deletion is judged to be less accented or not accented at all. The current study, therefore, recommends that language instructors attend to consonant errors in L2 speech while taking into consideration their respective phonological environments.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.2478/rela-2018-0008',\n","  'Monika Konert-Panek',\n","  'Singing Accent Americanisation in the Light of Frequency Effects: LOT Unrounding and PRICE Monophthongisation in Focus',\n","  2018,\n","  'The paper investigates – within the framework of usage-based phonology – the significance of lexical frequency effects in singing accent Americanisation.

The modality notions with ideational and interpersonal functions are content and person-oriented, respectively. While all dynamic modal notions are characterized by objectivity, deontic and epistemic modal notions may display a degree of (inter)subjectivity depending on their embedding context. Our main claim is that (inter)subjectivity can hardly be argued to be the inherent property of certain modality forms and types, but rather it is essentially a contextual effect. We functionally-operationally define (inter)subjectivity as the degree of sharedness an evaluator attributes to an epistemic/deontic evaluation and its related evidence/deontic source. (Inter)subjectivity is realized by (at least) one or a combination of three contextual factors, viz. the embedding syntactic pattern, the linguistic context and the extralinguistic context of a modality marker. Since both descriptive and performative modal evaluations involve a degree of (inter)subjectivity, performativity, which refers to speaker’s current commitment to his evaluation, is viewed as an independent dimension within modal evaluations and plays no part in the expression of (inter)subjectivity.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.2478/rela-2018-0004',\n","  'Hannah N.

Triangulating data from target-text products, keystroke logs and retrospective verbal commentaries collected under very similar conditions in a laboratory setting, we analyse how translators at different levels of experience handle two complex conceptual metaphors.

My approach shares its general impetus with Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk’s concept of re-conceptualization, but is independently derived from findings in cognitive linguistics and simulation theory (see e.g. Langacker, 2008; Feldman, 2006; Barsalou, 1999; Zwaan, 2004). Against this background, I propose a model of translation processing focused on the internal simulation of reader reception and the calibration of these simulations to achieve similarity between ST and TT impact. The concept of cognitive equivalence is exemplarily tested by exploring a conceptual / lexical field (MALE BALDNESS) through the way that English, German and Japanese lexical items in this field are linked to matching visual-conceptual representations by native speaker informants. The visual data gathered via this empirical method can be used to effectively triangulate the linguistic items involved, enabling an extra-linguistic comparison across languages. Results show that there is a reassuring level of inter-informant agreement within languages, but that the conceptual domain for BALDNESS is linguistically structured in systematically different ways across languages.

Students tended to use more of repetitions and made minimal use of synonyms and lexical sets to achieve cohesion in writing. This has led to poorly written essays by students. It also implies that lexical cohesion elements should be taught in schools to enable students use them appropriately in writing.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1515/rela-2016-0012',\n","  'Kamil Kaźmierski; Ewelina Wojtkowiak; Andreas Baumann',\n","  'Coalescent assimilation across word-boundaries in American English and in Polish English',\n","  2016,\n","  'Coalescent assimilation (CA), where alveolar obstruents /t, d, s, z/ in word-final position merge with word-initial /j/ to produce postalveolar /tʃ, dʒ, ʃ, ʒ/, is one of the most wellknown connected speech processes in English. Due to its commonness, CA has been discussed in numerous textbook descriptions of English pronunciation, and yet, upon comparing them it is difficult to get a clear picture of what factors make its application likely. This paper aims to investigate the application of CA in American English to see a) what factors increase the likelihood of its application for each of the four alveolar obstruents, and b) what is the allophonic realization of plosives /t, d/ if the CA does not apply. To do so, the Buckeye Corpus (Pitt et al. 2007) of spoken American English is analyzed quantitatively. As a second step, these results are compared with Polish English; statistics analogous to the ones listed above for American English are gathered for Polish English based on the PLEC corpus (Pęzik 2012). The last section focuses on what consequences for teaching based on a native speaker model the findings have. It is argued that a description of the phenomenon that reflects the behavior of speakers of American English more accurately than extant textbook accounts could be beneficial to the acquisition of these patterns.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1515/rela-2016-0015',\n","  'Michał Kuźmicki',\n","  'Neutralization in Aztec Phonology – The Case of Classical Nahuatl Nasals',\n","  2016,\n","  'This article investigates nasal assimilation in Classical Nahuatl.

The studied grammatical phenomena are problematic for all L2 learners of Swedish and are especially difficult for learners, such as Finns, whose L1 lacks expressive definiteness morphologically. The informants produce complex NPs already in their first narratives. The form of NPs poses significantly more problems than the choice of a correct form of definiteness. Hence, it is possible that previous knowledge in English helps informants in the choice of definiteness. The common nominator for problematic expressions is simplification, in both formal aspects and in the relation between form and meaning. Previous research in Sweden has made similar findings. The most central types of NPs build an acquisition explainable by a complexity hierarchy between the different types of NPs. The informants master best NPs without definiteness markers. Definite singulars containing an ending are significantly easier than indefinite singulars, the indefinite article of which is notoriously difficult for Finns learning Swedish as an L2. This acquisition order, however, profoundly differs from the traditional order of instruction of their compendiums.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1515/rela-2016-0017',\n","  'Ni Luh Putu Sri Adnyani; I Wayan Pastika',\n","  'Phonological development in the early speech of an Indonesian-German bilingual child',\n","  2016,\n","  'Current research in bilingual children’s language development with one language dominant has shown that one linguistic system can affect the other.

It uses data from the study of a child simultaneously acquiring Indonesian and German between the ages of 12 months - 20 months, with Indonesian as the dominant language. The sound segments developed by the child showed universal tendencies, with the appearance of bilabials prior to alveolar sounds, followed by velar sounds. The sounds were produced mostly in the form of stops, nasals and glides. Three phonological processes were displayed by the child: substitution, assimilation and syllable structures. The front rounded vowel [ʏ], which exists in German but not in the Indonesian sound system, was systematically replaced by the palatal approximant [j]. This approximant exists in the Indonesian sound system but not in the German phonemic inventory. This provides evidence that, in terms of phonological development, the child experienced CLI, but only for certain sound transfers.',\n","  'Research in Language'],\n","

The song is memorable not only because of its innovative use of language by Liu Bannong in the lyrics but also because of the ingenious arrangement of tonalities, forms, and melodies by Chao Yuen Ren in the music. This essay will be devoted to a cultural and empirical analysis of the song, with the aim of understanding the efforts made by eminent scholars at the early stage of modernization of Chinese music and language. To this end, we will first explore how the lyrics are structured phonetically and syntactically. Tonal complexity and ambiguity in the music will then be analyzed, followed by the discussion of qǐ-chéng-zhuǎn-hé in the musical form. The pentatonicism embedded in the song and its relationship with what generally makes music \"sound Chinese\" will also be examined. In the end, we will also review an essential concept, yìjìng (or mindscape), in Chinese aesthetics and philosophy to better appreciate how various components in the music and lyrics together contribute to the aesthetic success of the song.摘要:在中国艺术歌曲曲目中，《教我如何不想他》自上世纪 20 年代发表以 来便一直享有极高的声誉。作品中刘半农创造性的语言用法让人耳目 一新，而赵元任融汇中西的和声技法及曲式运用更是中国音乐近代化 的代表性诠释。本文旨在通过对该歌曲的文化与实证分析，探讨中国 音乐和语言中的近代化元素。我们首先对歌词的语音语义以及篇章结 构进行分析，然后在中西方乐理的比较框架下研究音乐的调性、曲式 结构以及旋律构成。其中我们将具体讨论曲中转调的丰富性、离调的 歧义性、起承转合的运用以及五声调式与中国风音乐的关系。最后， 我们还将分析歌曲音乐背后所体现的中国传统美学中的一个关键概念——意境。',\n"," 'Journal of Chinese

corpus and the Markov model-based \"Hockett-Wang algorithm\". The results show that, compared to vowels and consonants, tones carry the smallest functional load. In tones that are associated with monosyllabic, bi-syllabic, and multi-syllabic words, the functional load is inversely related to the number of syllables in that word. In other words, the more syllables in a word, the further the functional load of tones tends to decrease. Importantly, this study reveals a close correlation between the functional load of Chinese tones and the evolution of these tones. This is evidenced by the perceived imbalance of the functional load of different tonal contrasts within contemporary Chinese, as well as by the simulation results of the drastically declining functional load of Chinese tones in diachronic. These results may suggest that the declining load of Chinese tones is indeed the underlying driver for the merger and the resulting decline in the number of Chinese tones. The conclusions of the paper may shed new light for future research in the fields of phonology, speech engineering, as well as second language teaching.

Lizu has been argued to have a hybrid prosodic system combining lexical tone on monosyllabic words and prominence patterns with stress-like and tonal characteristics on polysyllabic words, although empirical evidence is lacking. This study presents an acoustic investigation of the pitch patterns on disyllabic words in the Kala variety of Lizu (HL, HH, LH). Using the parameters of duration, intensity, and f0, it attempts to sort out different forms of prominence, and to explore their interaction with lexical tone. The measurements are taken from experimental data with eight Lizu speakers (4 male and 4 female). The acoustic results and statistical analyses suggest that the first syllable in Kala Lizu is the position of prominence in all three pitch patterns. Our results are consistent with interpreting the pitch pattern HL as more stress-like (with intensity as an acoustic correlate of stress) and the pitch patterns HH and LH as more tone-like (with stress cued by full realization of lexical tone). This study contributes to a better understanding of the prosodic organization of Kala Lizu and it also suggests methodology for further exploration of other Lizu varieties.

One is to learn and imitate, while the other is to learn and innovate. As a visionary, William S-Y. Wang (1999) innovates. He rejected purely formal theories such as the Generative Grammar and envisioned an Indigenous Chinese Grammar (ICG) that takes culture into consideration. Echoing Wang’s seminal vision, we offer a possible ICG. We focus on the perplexing pair of cai2 才 (‘necessary’) and jiu4 就 (‘sufficient’). Both cai2 and jiu4 have divergent meanings that may be closely related, well related, remotely related, or even dubiously related. (See for example, you3qian2 cai2 jia4 ta1 ‘Marry him only if he is rich’, ta1 cai2 lai2 ‘He has just come’, wo3 cai2 you3qian2 ‘I am the one that has money’, wo3 cai2 bu2 pao4 ne0 ‘I contrary to anybody’s expectation am not afraid’.) Traditional formal theories seem unable to explain this wide range of divergence. But an Emergent Grammar (EG) can. Given a composition, EG enables its two elements to ‘interact’ into a largely unpredictable result. Free interactions in a specific context produce flexible results, making the derived meanings often unpredictable, as one would expect from a Complex system as opposed to a Complicated system. Realized as a complex-systematic approach to Chinese grammar, Wang’s brilliant insight of ICG could well inspire and help launch a fresh advancement path in Chinese linguistics.',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2017.0134',\n","  'W.

AUTONOMOUS SYNTAX AND INTERFACE INTERACTION When Chomsky set up the generative grammar theory framework in the 1950s, he made it clear that the same set of rules and structural representations, which he called universal grammar (UG), provide the basis for the individual grammar of every language (Chomsky 1957). The ultimate goal for establishing generative grammar is to figure out what these rules are and how they work. As means to achieve his goal, Chomsky gave up the fundamental assumptions of structuralism and divided language studies into modules such as syntax, semantics, phonetics, phonology and so on. His intention is to study each module independently without referring to the others and a new term “autonomous syntax” is created to convey this idea, illustrated by the well-known sentence “colorless green ideas sleep furiously”. He admits that this sentence is semantically absurd but insists that it is syntactically well-formed and Acknowledgements This paper is an output of the NSSFC Project “Studies of Chinese in Generative Grammar and Innovation of Grammatical Theory (18ZDA291)”.

The research conducted along the line of autonomy of syntax and other modules made tremendous progress in the past sixty and so years, generated an enormous amount of literature and brought linguistic science to an all-time height. At the same time, some hidden problems emerged gradually and one of them is related to the autonomy of syntax. To segment language into independent modules is in a sense an adaption of a common practice in scientific research and naturally inherits the shortcomings of such practice. A natural language is the means of describing the world and conveying thoughts for its speakers and it always works as a whole. Taking the language apart makes it easier to analyze its individual modules but also makes it harder to understand the interaction between modules. Chomsky’s solution to this problem is to evoke interface operations, which are supposed to involve two or more modules, The original assumption is that interface operations bring the product of one module into another module. When a structure reaches Sstructure as the final product of syntax, the structure is pure syntactical and will have to go across to PF to get pronunciation or to LF to get semantic interpretation. This leads to the famous upside-down Y-shape model of syntax (Chomsky 1981, 1982) and its later versions. The interface idea leads to quite a number of break-throughs and the most influential one in the GB era is perhaps the LF-movement of Chinese wh-in-situ (Huang 1982). An important assumption of formal syntax is that the sentenceinitial wh-phrase of a question in English or French is generated in a different position determined by its syntactic-semantic relation with the predicate and is then moved to its final position according to syntactic rules. The Chinese wh-phrases pose a challenge to this line of analysis in that they do not move in syntax but have almost the same scope properties like their English counterparts. This loophole was fixed when Huang put forward his interface operation analysis, assuming Chinese wh-in-situs also undergo movement to get the correct interpretation like their English counterparts and the only difference is that Chinese wh-in-situs move at LF. The mechanism of interface interaction is also invoked to analyze some phenomena occurring between D-structure and S-structure, and the best-known case is the analysis of certain in-situ English wh-words.

The results show that, compared to vowels and consonants, tones carry the smallest functional load. In tones that are associated with monosyllabic, bi-syllabic, and multi-syllabic words, the functional load is inversely related to the number of syllables in that word. In other words, the more syllables in a word, the further the functional load of tones tends to decrease. Importantly, this study reveals a close correlation between the functional load of Chinese tones and the evolution of these tones. This is evidenced by the perceived imbalance of the functional load of different tonal contrasts within contemporary Chinese, as well as by the simulation results of the drastically declining functional load of Chinese tones in diachronic. These results may suggest that the declining load of Chinese tones is indeed the underlying driver for the merger and the resulting decline in the number of Chinese tones.

Although theoretical studies show that there is a covert dependency between the in-situ question word/phrase and SpecCP, little is known how this dependency is evidenced in the processing of Mandarin wh-in-situ questions. In addition, bare Mandarin wh-phrases like shéi \\'who\\' are different from complex ones like nǎge tóngxué \\'which classmate\\', as the former are known as wh-indeterminates, on a par with indefinites (Cheng 1991), while the latter are considered on a par with definites (Rullmann and Beck 1998). To uncover the processing mechanism of wh-in-situ questions, we conducted two self-paced reading studies where we compared their processing behavior with that of their declarative counterparts. Specifically, and due to the claims made in the literature regarding the nature of bare and complex wh-questions, we compared bare wh-questions with declarative counterparts that contained indefinites, and complex wh-questions with declarative counterparts that contained definites. Our findings show that, regardless of their bare or complex nature, wh-questions were in general processed with more cost (i.e., reading delay) than their declarative counterparts, providing evidence that a covert-dependency is built in wh-questions. In particular, based on our results we claim that after reading the core whelement, the parser immediately starts the process of resolving the wh-question interpretation by establishing the covert dependency.摘要:汉语普通话的特殊疑问句是在位疑问句，即疑问词的位置和陈述句对应名词的位置相同(例如\"约翰买了什么？\")，并不移到句首。理论语言学的研究表明，在位的疑问词与句子左缘的 SpecCP 存在隐性的依存关系，但这种依存关系能否从在线句子加工中找到证据，尚不得而知。除此之外，光杆疑问词(例如\"谁\")与复杂的疑问词(例如\"哪个同学\")本质不同，因为前者是 wh-不定指，类似于不定代词 (Cheng 1991), 而后者性质与有定代词类似 (Rullmann and Beck, 1998)。为了更好地揭示普通话特殊疑问句的加工机制，文章进行了两个自控步速阅读实验，来对比疑问句和对应陈述句的加工模式。具体说来，根据文献中对光杆疑问词和复杂疑问词的区分，我们分别对比了光杆疑问句和包含了对应不定代词陈述句的加工区别，以及复杂疑问句和包含了对应有定代词陈述句的加工区别。研究结果表明，尽管疑问词的性质有光杆和复杂之分，疑问句整体上都要比对应陈述句加工成本更高 (即需要更多的加工时间) 。这为普通话特殊疑问句中隐性依存关系的建构提供了在线加工上的证据。此外，实验的结果显示，只要阅读到 wh-成分 (例如\"哪个\"、\"谁\") ，被试就开始了疑问依存关系的建构，不需要读完整个词组 (例如\"哪个同学\")。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2017.0130',\n","  'Xianming Bei',\n","  'A study of the nasality of sound of Shuangfeng dialect.

Among the crucial questions to be satisfactorily resolved are at least the following eight: 1) What are the principal criteria that guide the lexicographer’s selection of the Cantonese lexical items that form the contents of the bilingual dictionary? Further, what is the scope of the lexical contents? Broad, by encompassing all lexical items that occur in the speech of Hong Kong Cantonese speakers, even those items that overlap with standard Chinese? Or, narrow, by focusing only on the uniquely Hong Kong Cantonese lexicon? 2) What categories of information about the lexical items should form the structural contents of lexical entries? These could include parts of speech, speech registers, cross-referencing of related lexical items, synonyms, alternative pronunciations and variant written forms, example sentences, etc. 3) How detailed should the equivalent English translations of the Cantonese lexical items be? 4) Should lexical entries include information on their social, cultural, historical, and political associations, usage, etymology (origin and historical development), etc.? 5) What is the organizing principle by which the Cantonese lexical entries are listed in the dictionary, as there are at least four? 6) As for Cantonese pronunciation, which register of the language should be romanized? The conservative, literary, standard pronunciation? The colloquial, informal, commonly-used 懶 音 laan5 jam1 “lazy” pronunciation? Or both of these? 7) Several Cantonese romanization systems are currently in use, so which one is best for representing Hong Kong’s contemporary Cantonese pronunciation? 8) Given that the written form of the Cantonese language has never been formally or officially standardized, so that some lexical items are typically written in two or more different ways, what criteria should guide the lexicographer in deciding how Cantonese words are graphically transcribed in a Cantonese-English dictionary?

Karlgren’s mistake creates a serious problem in the reconstruction of the vowel system of Middle Chinese. In the proposed reconstructions so far, excessive vocalic distinctions are required. This problem is well acknowledged but no explanations and solutions have been convincingly provided. Based on the information from the poetry rhyming before and at the same time of the Qieyun, our analyses of the Qieyun rhymes with the -ŋ ending indicate that 1) not all the Qieyun rhymes are different VCs, and 2) some Qieyun rhymes are the preservation of historical categories. With the new understanding of the nature of the Qieyun rhymes, the required main vowels of Middle Chinese can be significantly reduced. The twelve Qieyun rhymes with -ŋ require only six main vowels. The observation that not all the Qieyun rhymes are different VCs can be supported by the recent distribution analyses of the Qieyun rhymes. A fundamental viewpoint of this article is that in the study of the phonological history of Chinese, what should be reconstructed is the phonological system of Middle Chinese instead of the so-called “Qieyun system”. Because the phonological categories contained in the Qieyun are neither synchronically systematic nor phonologically consistent, the Qieyun does not represent a single phonological system of any historical period in the phonological history of Chinese.',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2023.0001',\n","  '',\n","  'The voiced and released stop codas of Old Chinese',\n","  2023,\n","  'This paper discusses the property of voicing and releasing in coda stops in Old Chinese, which is of great significance to the phonetic types and historical comparison between Chinese and Tibetan Languages.

By Yafei Li. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2022. Pp. xviii, 310. ISBN 9781108885935 (ebook) 1. AUTONOMOUS SYNTAX AND INTERFACE INTERACTION When Chomsky set up the generative grammar theory framework in the 1950s, he made it clear that the same set of rules and structural representations, which he called universal grammar (UG), provide the basis for the individual grammar of every language (Chomsky 1957). The ultimate goal for establishing generative grammar is to figure out what these rules are and how they work. As means to achieve his goal, Chomsky gave up the fundamental assumptions of structuralism and divided [End Page 247] language studies into modules such as syntax, semantics, phonetics, phonology and so on. His intention is to study each module independently without referring to the others and a new term \"autonomous syntax\" is created to convey this idea, illustrated by the well-known sentence \"colorless green ideas sleep furiously\". He admits that this sentence is semantically absurd but insists that it is syntactically well-formed and could be studied on its own. The research conducted along the line of autonomy of syntax and other modules made tremendous progress in the past sixty and so years, generated an enormous amount of literature and brought linguistic science to an all-time height. At the same time, some hidden problems emerged gradually and one of them is related to the autonomy of syntax. To segment language into independent modules is in a sense an adaption of a common practice in scientific research and naturally inherits the shortcomings of such practice. A natural language is the means of describing the world and conveying thoughts for its speakers and it always works as a whole. Taking the language apart makes it easier to analyze its individual modules but also makes it harder to understand the interaction between modules. Chomsky\\'s solution to this problem is to evoke interface operations, which are supposed to involve two or more modules. The original assumption is that interface operations bring the product of one module into another module. When a structure reaches S-structure as the final product of syntax, the structure is pure syntactical and will have to go across to PF to get pronunciation or to LF to get semantic interpretation. This leads to the famous upside-down Y-shape model of syntax (Chomsky 1981, 1982) and its later versions. The interface idea leads to quite a number of break-throughs and the most influential one in the GB era is perhaps the LF-movement of Chinese wh-in-situ (Huang 1982). An important assumption of formal syntax is that the sentence-initial wh-phrase of a question in English or French is generated in a different position determined by its syntactic-semantic relation with the predicate and is then moved to its final position according to syntactic rules. The Chinese wh-phrases pose a challenge to this line of analysis in that they do not move in syntax but have almost the same scope properties like their English counterparts. This loophole was fixed when Huang put forward his interface operation analysis, assuming Chinese wh-in-situs also [End Page 248] undergo movement to get the correct interpretation like their English counterparts and the only difference is that Chinese wh-in-situs move at LF. The mechanism of interface interaction is also invoked to analyze some phenomena occurring between D-structure and S-structure, and the best-known case is the analysis of certain in-situ English wh-words. When who bought what is understood as a direct question, what can have wide scope even though it stays in-situ, and the question should be replied with a paired answer for the two wh-words, in the form of John bought a book or Mary bought a computer. This is apparently another loophole in the autonomous syntactic operation and any possible solution is not likely to come from the syntactic module alone. A solution by Pesetsky (1987) is that such a question is valid only in a particular discourse where each person in a group has purchased...

Lizu has been argued to have a hybrid prosodic system combining lexical tone on monosyllabic words and prominence patterns with stress-like and tonal characteristics on polysyllabic words, although empirical evidence is lacking. This study presents an acoustic investigation of the pitch patterns on disyllabic words in the Kala variety of Lizu (HL, HH, LH). Using the parameters of duration, intensity, and f0, it attempts to sort out different forms of prominence, and to explore their interaction with lexical tone. The measurements are taken from experimental data with eight Lizu speakers (4 male and 4 female). The acoustic results and statistical analyses suggest that the first syllable in Kala Lizu is the position of prominence in all three pitch patterns. Our results are consistent with interpreting the pitch pattern HL as more stress-like (with intensity as an acoustic correlate of stress) and the pitch patterns HH and LH as more tone-like (with stress cued by full realization of lexical tone). This study contributes to a better understanding of the prosodic organization of Kala Lizu and it also suggests methodology for further exploration of other Lizu varieties.摘要:本研究考察里汝语中韵律突显的声学相关物。里汝语曾被认为拥有一 种混合的韵律系统，结合了单音节词的声调，以及多音节词上的重音 似的和声调式的突显格局，尽管缺乏相关的实证证据。本研究对木里 县卡拉乡里汝语不同音高模式(HL、HH、LH)的双音节词进行了声学 考察，使用音长、音强和基频的参数，确定不同类型双音节词中的突 显形式，并探讨这些突显与词层面声调之间的相互关系。测量数据来 自 8 位里汝语母语者(4 男 4 女)的语音实验。声学结果和统计分析表 明，卡拉乡里汝语的全部三种音高模式中，第一个音节都处于突显位置，HL 类型的音高模式表现得更像重音(以音强为重音的声学相关物)， HH 和 LH 类型的音高模式表现得更像声调(以词调的完整实现来体现 重音)。这项研究有助于更好地理解里汝语的韵律结构，并为进一步探 索其他里汝语土语提供了方法。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2017.0107',\n","  'Sze-Wing Tang',\n","  'On the Syntax of the Negative Marker mei6 in Cantonese',\n","  2022,\n","  'Syntactic properties of the negative marker mei6 in the preverbal and sentence final positions in Cantonese are examined in this paper.

Compared with Modern Chinese, Archaic Chinese seems to have a richer encoding for relative clauses. It has three possible relative markers: zhe, zhi and suo. In this article, we will approach to Archaic Chinese relatives from the perspective of formal syntax. We will argue that zhe is a subject relative pronoun and suo a VP internal relative pronoun, and that zhe- and suo-relatives are derived from the A\\'-movement of the relevant relative pronoun to the peripheral position, creating an operator-variable relation at LF. Simultaneously, we will use Cecchetto and Donati\\'s labeling theory to account for a peculiar phenomenon that the same relative pronoun can form both headless and headed relatives. We will further argue that the relative marker zhi, as English that, is an invariant relativizer occupying the C position, and that zhi-relatives involve null operator movement. That is to say, like English type of languages, Archaic Chinese actually involves two separate relativizing strategies: through a relative pronoun or a null operator. The article also contributes to the debate on the analysis of relatives: data from Archaic Chinese favors an Adjunction Analysis to the Raising Analysis (or Complementation Analysis) à la Kayne.摘要:众所周知，现代汉语中所有的关系从句均由\"的\"引导。相比之下， 上古汉语中关系从句的表现形式则更为丰富，共有\"者\"\"之\"\"所\" 三种关系化标记。本文将从形式句法的视角探讨上古汉语的上述三种 关系从句。我们认为\"者\"是主语关系代词，而\"所\"是VP内关系代 词，带\"者\"或\"所\"的关系从句是通过关系代词A\\'移动至边缘位置 而生成的，并借此在LF 层建立了算子–变量关系。同时，我们将采用 Cecchetto 和Donati 的加标理论来解释上古汉语中同一个关系代词既可 构成无核关系从句，又可构成有核关系从句这一奇特的语法现象。至 于关系化标记\"之\"，我们认为它与英语中的that 相似，是标句词C， 而\"之\"引导的关系从句则是通过空算子移位生成的。也就是说，上 古汉语和英语类语言一样，都具有两种独立的关系化策略，即要么通 过关系代词实现关系化，要么通过空算子实现关系化。另外，此文还 将对目前学界关于关系从句分析方法的争论起到一定的参考作用：上 古汉语的语料证明了嫁接分析法要优于Kayne 的提升(或称补语)分析 法。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2022.0030',\n","  '瑞文 吳',\n","  '論現代湘語中的仙先之別及其早期形式的擬測',\n","  2022,\n","  '摘要:本文以現代湘語方言為基礎,利用《切韻》框架探討其中存在的山攝開口三四等——亦即仙韻與先韻——的音韻區別,並根據現代湘語的實際語音表現,擬測原始湘語中這一對韻母的早期形式(proto form)。關於現代湘語是否能夠區分山攝仙先,學者間存在正反不同的意見。本文在前人的基礎上擴大比較湘語的範圍以及同源詞數量,一方面證明原始湘語中仙先的語音區別,一方面擬測其原始形式。本文的結論認為:1)現代湘語中確實保存仙先的區別,並在中古精系聲母及來母的環境下存在對立;2)根據現代湘語的語音表現,仙三在原始湘語可擬為*-iɑn, 先四則可擬為*-ian; 3)透過吳ˎ閩ˎ湘三個原始方言的比較,可以建立六朝江東方言*-iɑn 與*-ian 的對立。這個現象顯示江東方言與湘語的密切關係。ABSTRACT:Based on the framework of the Qièyùn (切韻) system, this paper explores phonological distinctions between Grade III and Grade IV of the Shān Shè (山攝) rhyme group, namely the Xiān (仙) and Xiān (先) rhyme, in Modern Xiang .

This research discusses the expression of the affix \"bu\" in the translation of Manchu into Chinese in QingWenZhiYao Manchu and Chinese versions. It is found that in Manchu causative sentence, the absence of causee, marked or not, and animacy hierarchy directly lead to three strategies in Chinese translation: explicit causation, implicit causation and non-causation. The transitivity of verbs affects the choice of causation or permission in Chinese translation. This shows the affix “bu” is a prominent feature in Manchu causative sentence.

First, this paper systematically describes the complex and diverse combination types of synthetic compounds as well as their grammaticality and usability, and summarizes the main aspects and problems to be solved in terms of generative constraints of these compounds, which pave the way to propose a new approach from Stylistic-Register Grammar. With Spatio-Temporal Principle and operational rules of Stylistic-Register Grammar, this paper analyzes the specific constraints on the grammaticality and usability of different types of synthetic compounds, and explains the motivations of special types and cases. Therefore, this paper suggests that the so-called exceptions, special examples or counter-examples are essentially the results of multiple interactions, while the differences of typological features of synthetic compounds are the results of interactions between structural characteristics and specific register motivations, which provide a good reference for the establishment of stylistic-register typology.

INSIGHT ON THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF PROSODY: A RESPONSE TO DUANMU’S RHYTHMIC ANALYSIS Shengli Feng Beijing Language and Culture University, Beijing The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 1. WHAT IS RHYTHM: DUANMU’S ANALYSIS Rhythm is a fundamental notion in music, poetry, as well as the prosodic systems of human language. Though there have been rich discussions about what rhythm is and how it functions, it has taken until now to arrive at a general and precise definition of rhythm as in Duanmu (2022), which states as follows: (1) Definition of rhythm a. Rhythm is the repetition of a unit of alternation. b. A unit of alternation consists of two non-identical parts A and B. Based on the definition of rhythm, Duanmu (2022, 262) also develops a representation of poetic line as in (2) and that of poem as in (3). Acknowledgments I thank San Duanmu (端木三) and Yafei Li (李亚非) for their inspiring ideas, comments and suggestions in writing this paper. I also thank Qiuwu Ma (马秋武), Qi Gong (宫 齐), Zhiqiang Li (李智强), Wen Cao (曹文), Feng-fan Hsien (谢丰帆), Xiangdong Shi (施向东), Chunhong Shi (施春宏), and the anonymous reviewers for their comments.

Unit of repetition: a disyllabic trochaic foot b. Parts of alternation: A is a stressed syllable; B is an unstressed syllable. (3) Representation of a poem a. Unit of repetition: a poetic line b. Parts of alternation: A is a given number of feet; B is a boundary #. The arguments and the analyses offered by Duanmu are insightful and important. In general, whether in the East or in the West, the notion of rhythm and that of repetition are almost interchangeable. However, in poetry, as Duanmu points out, rhythm is organized by repetition of alternating units, and it operates in all languages at all levels too (see also Feng and Shi 2021). The new definition of rhythm makes a necessary and important correction on previous misunderstandings of what human rhythm involves. Duanmu (2022) also offers a judgment experiment on perceived rhythmicality of Chinese poems and discovers some rhythmic contrasts between riming and poem structure on the one hand, and shuāngshēng 双 声 ‘repeated adjacent onsets’, diéyùn 叠韵 ‘repeated adjacent rimes’, consonance, and assonance on the other. The former two have significant effects on perceived rhythmicality, while the latter four contribute little to this aspect. This study has far-reaching ramifications for future studies on rhythmic objects with their perceived rhythmicality. 2. DIFFERENT OPINIONS Although Duanmu’s (2022) analysis is insightful, there are some crucial points about the nature of rhythm which differ from Feng and Shi’s (2021) proposal, as summarized in Duanmu (2022, 271), repeated in (4). (4) Feng and Shi (2021, 42) distinguish rhythm in language and rhythm in nature: Rhythm in language (jiélǜ 节 律 ): The repetition unit contains an alternation. Rhythm in nature (jiézòu 节 奏 ): The repetition unit contains no alternation. ON BIOLOGICAL PROSODY 3 Duanmu (2022, 272) comments as follows: Feng and Shi (2021) are probably right to propose that there is a difference between rhythm in speech and rhythm in other things. However, the difference does not seem to lie in the lack of alternation in non-speech rhythms. For example, there is an alternation between beat and pause in drum beats, and there is an alternation between day and night in a daily cycle. We can, instead, distinguish speech rhythm and other rhythms by the units of alternation: In speech, the alternating units are phonological categories, such as syllables...

By investigating these two words, we find that in Lianjiang Yue dialect, Guigang Yue dialect and Hakka dialect, “guan” has grammaticalized from descriptive complement to habitual particle, while in Guangzhou dialect “guan” has not evolved in this way. The habitual particle in Guangzhou dialect is “kai”. There are two paths of grammaticalization for the habitual particles in Chinese dialect. One is from descriptive complement to habitual aspect (such as “kai” in Guangzhou dialect, and “guan2” in Lianjiang dialect), while the other is from verb to auxiliary verb (such as “guan1” in Lianjiang Yue dialect).

By investigating these two words, we find that in Lianjiang Yue dialect, Guigang Yue dialect and Hakka dialect, “guan” has grammaticalized from descriptive complement to habitual particle, while in Guangzhou dialect “guan” has not evolved in this way. The habitual particle in Guangzhou dialect is “kai”. There are two paths of grammaticalization for the habitual particles in Chinese dialect. One is from descriptive complement to habitual aspect (such as “kai” in Guangzhou dialect, and “guan2” in Lianjiang dialect), while the other is from verb to auxiliary verb (such as “guan1” in Lianjiang Yue dialect). Auxiliary verbs, descriptive complements and aspect particles referring to habitual meaning all fall into the habitual category, and they are important to the study of the habitual category in Chinese.

In tones that are associated with monosyllabic, bi-syllabic, and multi-syllabic words, the functional load is inversely related to the number of syllables in that word. In other words, the more syllables in a word, the further the functional load of tones tends to decrease. Importantly, this study reveals a close correlation between the functional load of Chinese tones and the evolution of these tones. This is evidenced by the perceived imbalance of the functional load of different tonal contrasts within contemporary Chinese, as well as by the simulation results of the drastically declining functional load of Chinese tones in diachronic.

The distributions of -haa5 are highly restricted: predicates eligible to co-occur with -haa5 are verbs/adjectives with an innate event/degree argument, excluding those whose semantics are of extreme/polarity reading.

However, there is still a lot of controversy. This paper puts forward a new analysis based on existing studies and aims to provide a more consistent description and explanation on generative mechanism and constraints of all types of synthetic compounds. First, this paper systematically describes the complex and diverse combination types of synthetic compounds as well as their grammaticality and usability, and summarizes the main aspects and problems to be solved in terms of generative constraints of these compounds, which pave the way to propose a new approach from Stylistic-Register Grammar. With Spatio-Temporal Principle and operational rules of Stylistic-Register Grammar, this paper analyzes the specific constraints on the grammaticality and usability of different types of synthetic compounds, and explains the motivations of special types and cases. Therefore, this paper suggests that the so-called exceptions, special examples or counter-examples are essentially the results of multiple interactions, while the differences of typological features of synthetic compounds are the results of interactions between structural characteristics and specific register motivations, which provide a good reference for the establishment of stylistic-register typology. Lastly, this paper points out that the approach focusing on multi-interactive mechanism could inspire us to make new thinking on the methodologies in related research fields.',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2022.0029',\n","  '芸华 王',\n","  '湘语非完整体标记 “在屋里” 的聚焦度及其演变研究',\n","  2022,\n","  '摘要:湘语中的“在屋里”既能表示某一时点动作正在进行,也能表示某一时段动作的持续进行或惯常发生,还可以与形容词共现表示某种状态,呈现出“低聚焦”的特点。“在屋里”在演变过程中与“在这/那里” 相互竞争,经历了“高聚焦>低聚焦>零聚焦”的动态过程,其“低聚焦”性与“在这/那里”的“高聚焦”性在非完整体内部形成对立。“在屋里”的虚化受原型模型的驱动,同时隐喻、类推和重新分析等机制发挥了重要作用,其过程同时伴随主观性增强的特征。ABSTRACT:Zai wu-li (literally “in the house”) in Xiang dialect can be used to denote the progressiveness of an act in a particular time point, and the continuity or habituality of an act in a period of time, and can co-occur with adjectives to indicate a certain state.

The NP should be a direct time-denoting NPtime or an indirect time-denoting NPitime. Following Kayne (2016), we assume there is a silent TIME following de. Meanwhile, a less-discussed use of de—that is, the equational/appositional use of de (Chao 1968), has been revived to link the silent TIME and NPtime/NPitime. This analysis of de helps explain why the NP is preferably time-related, as it is easier for a time-denoting NP to establish an equational/appositional relation with the silent TIME. Dà \\'big\\' is neither a size-denoting adjective, nor an evaluative morpheme. It is analyzed as an element like the restrictive adjective very (e.g., the very book) in English. Dà modifies the appositive conjunction phrase [NP de TIME], bringing emphasis to the construction, which in turn imposes certain semantic and pragmatic constraints on its subsequent clauses.摘要:本文主要探讨\"大NP的\"结构是如何通过组合的方式生成的。本文认为该结构中的\"大\"既非指涉尺寸大小的形容词，也非表示评价的语素，而是一个表示强调的限制形容词，其用法类似于英文the very book中的very。受Kayne(2016)的启发，我们假设该结构的\"的\"字之后有个没有语音实现形式的时间名词TIME。受Chao(1968)启发，我们认为该结构中的\"的\"是\"的\"的一种特殊用法，即\"的\"等同/同位用法，用来连接表示时间的NP和无声的TIME。\"NP的TIME\"是一个同位结构，受\"大\"修饰。由于\"大\"的强调作用(Lü 1999)，\"大NP的\"结构具有强调义，继而要求其后续子句在语义和语用上与之匹配，从而对后续子句产生一定的限制。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2017.0133',\n","  'Wu-Yun Pan; Zining Zheng',\n","  'The Voiced and Released Stop Codas Of Old Chinese',\n","  2022,\n","  'This paper discusses the property of voicing and releasing in coda stops in Old Chinese, which is of great significance to the phonetic types and historical comparison between Chinese and Tibetan Languages.

It is found that both the subject-predicate and the prosody-syntax mismatched idioms elicited the P600 effect, whreas the coordinate idioms did not, and there is no significant difference in brain potentials between the subject-predicate and the prosody-syntax mismatched idioms. The results show that the cognitive processing of Chinese idioms is not a synthetic process of meaning extraction, but an analytic process based on the prosody-syntax interaction within the idioms. In addition, the processing of Chinese idioms is not affected by the syntactic relation between the constituents within the idiom.

But so far, no one knows why such a discourse is possible. This paper makes an attempt to discuss this issue. It is argued that the possibility of homophonic discourse is principally attributed to the fact that unlike English, the Chinese language has a unique bipartite spelling system, i.e., one composed of Chinese character spellings and Chinese pinyin spellings, and that they correspond to each other in terms of over 400 Chinese Pinyin syllables with variations through tones which satisfy the phonological, graphological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic premises for the construal of a homophonic discourse.摘要:前美国语言协会主席赵元任教授曾经写了一篇题为《施氏食狮史》的同音文。但迄今为止，尚无人知道该类同音文何以可能。对此本文进行了探讨。认为同音文之所以可能，主要是因为汉语不像英语，它有一个独特的双重拼写系统，即一个由汉字拼写与汉语拼音拼写构成的系统，这两个拼写子系统通过超过400个音节加声调变化相对应，能满足同音文构建所需的语音、拼写、形态、句法、语义和语用等前提条件。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2017.0062',\n","  'Yu Sun; Chunlian Li',\n","  'The Preliminary Research on the Design of Hanzi Braille',\n","  2019,\n","  '摘要:中国大陆目前通用的现行盲文本质上是一种音节盲文（或者称为拼音盲文），在盲文信息化和盲人识字方面表现出很多不足。本文旨在提出一种汉字盲文设计的框架结构以解决上述问题。汉字盲文基于现行盲文设计，利用现行盲文本身及在现行盲文前加标志位的方式定制盲文版汉字。这些标志位与汉字的偏旁相关联，不仅可以有效区分\\\\\"同音字\\\\\"，还可以表现汉字的意义。因此，汉字盲文虽然从\\\\\"音节盲文\\\\\"发展而来，但它突破了传统\\\\\"音节盲文\\\\\"的局限性，自成体系，在某种程度上有助于视力残疾人士更好的融入明眼人社会，也可以极大提高计算机汉字和盲文相互转换的效率。ABSTRACT:At present, the commonly used braille in mainland China is essentially a \\\\\"syllabic braille\\\\\" (or pinyin braille), which shows many deficiencies in promoting braille informatization and literacy for people with visual impairments.

These signs, which are associated with radicals of Chinese characters, help distinguishing homophones and expressing the meaning of a Chinese character.

Despite that their number is small, the behaviors of this group of morphemes are heterogeneous. While most of them can be followed by a nominal which denotes location, hei2 起 ‘raise (something) up’ and hoi1 開 ‘move away’ cannot. Moreover, the grammaticalization paths that they have undergone are significantly different even for those of the antonymic pairs.

Given that Mandarin allows serial motion construction with multiple verbal morphemes, it is always an intriguing question as to how the morphemes are combined and ordered. To account for the allowed and disallowed sequences of prototypical motion verbs, three sequencing principles are proposed on par with the Proto-Motion Event Schema proposed in Liu et al. (2015). The proposed principles help to set the semantic boundary of a serial motion sequence (The Boundary-Setting Principle), rule out morphological combinations that are against the default order (the Non-Regressional Principle), and account for the prominence and characteristics of Path in motion predication (the Path-Delimiting Principle). As Path is an integral part of motion, it has to be properly delimited with a Path-delimiting element. These three principles may together account for the multi-morpheme motion sequences whose morphological structures are highly correlated with lexical semantic structures.

It is a discipline devoted to the explanation of characters and expressions in ancient Chinese texts. The emergence of Xungu can be traced back to Er ya 爾雅, a Pre-Qin dictionary. The Han-Tang period, which is the heyday of the discipline, witnessed the production of many important Xungu works, most of them appearing in the form of commentaries. They have then become the indispensable guides to subsequent readers of classical Chinese texts. Given the canonical importance of these ancient commentaries, it is not surprising to see that most modern philologists regard the explanations of ancient Chinese texts offered in these classical Xungu works as authoritative dictionary meanings and uncritically adopt them in their own works. To date, however, little work has thoroughly examined how these ancient Xungu scholars arrived at their judgments. This article remedies this gap by clarifying the working mechanism of these ancient Xungu scholars in annotating ancient texts. It argues that these ancient Xungu scholars, when explaining a character in an ancient text, would first and foremost compare that text with parallel texts from other textual sources to identify textual variants. If a difference in terms of word choice existed between the text they were commenting and other relevant parallel texts, they would often uncritically use the latter to provide glosses to the former, even if the two were obviously not synonyms or near-synonyms. This article then shows that subsequent important philologists such as Zhu Junsheng 朱駿聲 (1788–1858) and Hong Yixuan 洪頤煊 (1765–1837), unaware of this unique working mechanism of ancient Xungu scholars, anachronistically mistook the judgments offered in these ancient Xungu works, which were simply made on the basis of textual variants, to be true and accurate dictionary meanings. As a result, they unavoidably established unnecessary connection between the semantically unrelated textual variants and ended up creating mistakes of their own.摘要:中國古代語言學之研究，重在訓詁。訓詁學乃中國傳統研究古書詞義 的專門學科，是中國傳統的語文學。訓詁之學，始於先秦的《爾雅》， 而大盛於漢晉的古籍注解。自漢代以來以迄於唐，古籍傳注蔚然成 風，其中重要典籍注家包括東漢《詩》毛《傳》，鄭玄《毛詩箋》，偽 孔安國的《尚書傳》，高誘《淮南子注》，三國六朝時王弼的《周易注》、 韋昭的《國語注》，王肅的《孔子家語注》，唐朝楊倞的《荀子注》等。 過去訓詁學家極重視古代典籍注解，視之為中國古代字義研究的重要 依據，鮮有懷疑這些古代學者的注解可有其他依據。本文嘗試援引書 證，以見漢晉以來諸家傳注訓詁，每有參考同書其他版本異文，甚或 互見文獻所見異文以為說解，例證甚多，自成系統。顯見據異文為注， 乃是中國學者注解典籍的一種傳統釋義方法。可惜過去語言學、訓詁 學者研習中國詞義詁訓時，於漢晉傳注相關訓解方式未有注意，未能 明晰此等訓詁其實源出重文異文，而重文異文又不必為同義甚或近義 詞。因之，此等字義訓詁既於古無徵，甚或扞格難通，後人不察，以 為相關字義解釋既出自漢晉著名學者，則其解讀自亦正確無誤，遂加 附會曲說，強為之解，舛誤乃生。本文提出諸如《說文》四大家的清 代學者朱駿聲、古籍義訓研究權威學者洪頤煊等，均因未明漢晉注家 上述訓釋詞義方法而產生誤解。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2018.0011',\n","  'Shelley Ching Yu Depner',\n","  \"It's more than eye to eye: Eye expressions in Mandarin Chinese and German\",\n","  2018,\n","  'This study examined the body-part eyes in Mandarin Chinese and German with the majority of the data taken from corpora and dictionaries.

Diversity in Sinitic Languages is the latest milestone in the exploration of the grammatical diversity across Chinese dialects. As the book title suggests, the editor views traditional Chinese dialect groups as related but different languages. The term ‘Sinitic languages’ will be used throughout this review.

From the same period when the primary edition of Jiu Manzhou Dang (Government archive of the early Manchu/Manzhou) [MG 1607–1636], we can see that the Manchus in the Northeast of China confused the two kinds of sounds at the beginning of learning Chinese language, which is described as the merge of jian and tuan sounds. After the entry of Manchus (1644), characterized by the merge of jian and tuan sounds, the imperfect Chinese language spoken by Manchus entered the inner city of Beijing and formed a contrast with the traditional Chinese language spoken by the Han people in the outer city of Beijing. Due to the implementation of the Manchu as the national language ( guoyu ) in the early Qing dynasty, the language spoken by Manchus in the inner city affected the language spoken by the Han people in the outer city through education. About 100 years later (1743–1810), in the spoken Chinese of the Han people in the outer city, the phenomenon of merging jian and tuan sounds appeared first only in some words, and then finally took over completely. This shows that the phenomenon of merging jian and tuan sounds in the Beijing dialect of the Qing dynasty is a result of the horizontal transmission of linguistic features from the Manchus in the inner city to the Han people in the outer city. The so-called \"horizontal transmission\" is the mutual effect between different languages when they contact with each other. The history of the Beijing dialect of the Qing dynasty is a history of the Manchus in the inner city abandoning the Manchu language, which was first converted imperfectly into the Chinese language and then finally merged with the spoken Chinese of the Han people in the outer city. In this process, on account of the special social status of the Manchus in the inner city, their spoken Chinese with the merge jian and tuan sounds affected that of the Han people in the outer city, and eventually prompted the same merge of two sounds of jian and tuan sounds among the latter, just as what had happened to the Manchus.',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2018.0000',\n","  'Haeree Park',\n","  'Old Chinese in the Excavated Late Archaic Script: Problems of Working with Competing Ideas in Reconstruction',\n","  2018,\n","  \"Excavated bamboo or wooden manuscripts dating from the 5th to 3rd centuries BCE have now become important new sources of data for Old Chinese phonology. The ways these sources are interpreted are necessarily based on methodological assumptions for Old Chinese reconstruction. So when debated issues in the latter are involved, disparate observations about the same materials turn out to manifest differences in the methodologies themselves. The study of Old Chinese through excavated manuscripts seems to become further complicated by considerations of the nature of the 'pre-Qin' archaic script and the provenances of the manuscripts. In response to these problems, as argued in this article, it is essential to recognize that the writings from the ancient Chu and Qin regions, notwithstanding the impressive range of graphic variability reaffirm the logographic nature of the Chinese writing system. The imperial 'script-unification' of the Qin dynasty was primarily an orthographic standardization in accordance with the norms of the old Qin region, whereby distinct regional variants were purged and preexisting internal variants were diminished. This by no means implicated such a drastic change in the writing system as a syllabary transforming to a logography. It is therefore necessary that the principles of OC reconstruction should be applied consistently to both the excavated archaic-script writings and transmitted early Chinese textual sources. It should be maintained first of all that the xiesheng (shared-phonophorics) and Shijing (the Book of Odes) rhymes in principle converge on a single phonological system, even though the actual history of the former is most probably older than the latter. This leads us to suppose about the OC vowel system that the Rounded Vowel Hypothesis does not hold, and that excavated texts have not yielded any data suggesting otherwise. Instead, this article suggests an alternative analysis of Middle Chinese (MC) - w - xiesheng series which had been received until that time; the regional variants thereof can complement each other as evidence for the Old Chinese phonology. When elements of dialects are found sporadically in the late archaic script, whether in Chu or Qin manuscripts, one may reasonably suspect that they reflect dialect-borrowings layered within the Old Chinese language.

Attempts to provide empirical evidence of the L2 English unergative-unaccusative distinction by adult Chinese speakers have only recently begun to appear. The present study investigates the acquisition of unergative and unaccusative verbs in L2 English by adult Chinese speakers. One hundred and twenty-one L1 Chinese speakers of different levels of English proficiency participated in a judgment test and a Chinese-English translation task. It is argued that the results are consistent with proposals made by Yip (1995) and Balcom (1997) which argue for overgeneralization of passive morphology to unaccusative verbs in L2 English. The results also show that, contrary to findings in the literature, learners have persistent difficulty establishing native-like syntactic realization of unergative verbs in L2 English: unergative verbs seem to have been interpreted as transitive verbs. It is speculated that the low accuracy on unergative verbs can be accounted for when Case assignment and the absence of positive evidence that unergative+NP construction is not allowed in English are factored in.Abstract:',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2018.0001',\n","  'San Duanmu; Shengli Feng; Yan Dong; Yingyue Zhang',\n","  'A Judgment Study of Length Patterns in Chinese: Prosody, Last Resort, and Other Factors',\n","  2017,\n","  \"In Chinese VO (verb-object) phrases, 2+1 (disyllabic + monosyllabic) is ill formed when other length patterns are available, such as 2+1 zhongzhi suan vs. the well-formed 2+2 zhongzhi dasuan 'plant garlic'. However, 2+1 VO is acceptable when alternative length patterns are unavailable, such as jieyue shui 'save water' and xihuan qian 'love money'. The conditional acceptance of 2+1 VO is known as the 'last resort' effect. However, the predicted judgment difference has not been demonstrated experimentally. In addition, it is unclear whether native speakers find the last resort 2+1 to be as good as 2+2. Moreover, it is unclear what other factors may affect native judgment. To address the questions, we conducted a judgment experiment. Our study shows that (i) 2+2 VO is ranked the best, (ii) 2+1 is ranked the worst when a better form is available, and (iii) the last resort 2+1 is ranked between (i) and (ii).

SP and EGG signals were synchronously recorded from 72 young undergraduates or postgraduates (42 females and 30 males) while they were reading aloud a wordlist of 50 disyllabic words at their most comfortable pitch, loudness and rate. VAT measures revealed three findings. (1) Vocal attack time shows no significant difference between the common yangping and the yangping derived from shangsheng . This, from a physiological perspective, supports the argument that the tone sequence 3–3 in Mandarin is indeed converted into 2–3, nothing else. (2) The tones of Mandarin Chinese that start from low pitch levels (35, 21) tend to present significantly different VAT values from those that start from high pitch levels (55, 51), with mean VATs of the former being much longer than those of the latter. This embodies the nonlinear contra-variant relationship between VAT and F0 at vowel onsets.

The sound changes are carried out by lexical diffusion, and the unit of diffusion is more likely to be disyllabic and other polysyllabic compound words rather than monosyllabic morphemes.

Second, he suggests that Buyang ma l 0 ɔk11 'deer' was borrowed as a whole from Zhuang maxloeg 'deer', itself borrowed from Chinese 马鹿 mǎlù 'red deer'. In this paper, I evaluate Prof. Ho's claims from the point of view of Kra-Dai historical phonology. First, I show that his assertion that Buyang ma l 0 ɔk11 'deer' is a Zhuang loanword is due to a misunderstanding of the cited source.

These compound verbs can take another element as their objects and yield expressions in the structural configuration [Vo1+O2]. From an evolutionary perspective, this corpus-based study attempts to explicate the syntactic as well as the semantic mechanisms behind the formation and interpretation of disyllabic transitive verbs. It is pointed out that (i) the [VN+O2] type, which has the largest number, goes through three evolutional phases during which Noun Incorporation plays a crucial role; (ii) the [Vv+O2] type is a nested complex structure, in which v is the object of V and is mostly transitive and hence capable to take one more object; (iii) although the above mentioned two types of compound verbs have different evolutional processes and mechanisms, they both indicate that there is a possibility that verbs can be converted from intransitive to transitive. 提要: 现代汉语里有一类双音节动宾式（[Vo]）复合动词，其中的宾语成分 o 可以是名词性语素、动词性语素等，如“观光”、“投资”、“留心”、 “注意”。鉴于这类动宾式动词可带宾语的数量在现代汉语中呈现逐渐上升趋势，本文尝试对这种动词的演化机制和内因做出诠释。通过数据统计与分析，本文指出：（1）[VN]式动词带宾语经历了三个演化阶段，其中“名词吸收”起了关键作用；（2） [Vv]式动词带宾语是一种嵌套式动宾结构，第二个 v 是第一个 V 的宾语，本身又是及物动词，故[Vv]具有带宾语的可能性；（3）动宾式动词演化机制及过程并非完全相同，但都反映了及物动词与不及物动词相互转化的可能性。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2018.0004',\n","  'Yuchau E.

This paper employs the theory of Cophonology, and posits four cophonologies to account for the partial and total reduplications.

Perhaps the harshest critique of this linguistic habit is found in the well-received novel of Wei Cheng ‘Fortress Besieged’ by Qian Zhongshu, who compared the English words embedded in one’s Chinese speech to bits of meat stuck between one’s teeth. This mercilessly sarcastic criticism well demonstrates how insertion of English words in Chinese utterances is often stigmatized as showing off in either China or Taiwan. Hong Kong people, nonetheless, are blessed that they can be exempted from such judgment. Indeed, codemixing or translanguaging is not only commonly heard from TV channels, radio stations, or even on the streets, especially among college students, but the ability to switch between Chinese and English has been what is expected of the Hong Kong citizens, as exemplified by the Special Administrative Region’s language policy of biliteracy and trilingualism.

An eye-tracking experiment was conducted to monitor eye movements of native participants in reading Chinese regulated poems in four segmenting conditions: normal text, character segmentation, rhythmic segmentation, and syntactic segmentation. By comparing a set of measures of eye movements, both global and local analyses showed that syntactic segmentation boosted reading efficiency, while rhythmic segmentation did not.

The rhyme table Shengyinchanghetu put the Ping tone character ‘dan’ with dental initial of Han rhyme at the ‘Fa’ line corresponding to the second division in the early traditional rhyme table Yunjing, together with the character ‘shan’ of Shan rhyme, but the Ping tone character ‘an’ with velar initial at the ‘Kai’ line corresponding to the first division, which shows that, in the Han rhyme, the rhyme with dental and sibilant initial is belonging to second division but the rhyme with velar initial is belonging to the first division. This is the headstream of acute-grave divergence of the Han rhyme in the historial documents. The so-called acute-grave divergence of the Han rhyme refers to the sound change in which the vowel of characters of the Han rhyme with acute initials diverges from the original vowel shared with their counterparts with grave initials, and merges with the vowel of the characters of the second division. This sound change is taking place in the 11th century northern dialects, and exhibits some regional variations in the paths taken. The transition is completed first for characters of Shang tone and Qu tone in the Bian-Luo dialect of the Northern Song Dynasty, as shown in the rhyme dictionary Jiyun, while first for characters of Ping tone in the You-Yan dialect of the Northern Song Dynasty, as documented in the rhyme table Shengyinchanghetu. In Mengguziyun and Zhongyuanyinyun, despite the fact that, irrespective of their initials, characters of Ping, Shang and Qu tones of the Han rhyme have the same vowel as characters of the second division, characters of Ru tone of the Han rhyme do exhibit patterns characteristic of the acute-grave divergence. This is clear evidence that the northern dialects of the Yuan Dynasty have undergone the acute-grave divergence. In the Yuan Dynasty, the vowels of characters with grave initials are further merged with that of characters of the second division. However, the loss of the ending *-t has excluded characters of Ru tone from the second wave of merging, resulting in the observed separation of Hanshan and Huanhuan. Therefore, the acute-grave divergence of the rhyme Han and the separation of the rhymes Hanshan and Huanhuan are two different phases of the single process in the history of northern dialects in which the low-back vowel *ɔ is replaced by low-front vowel *a before the endings *-t/*-n. The separation of Hanshan and Huanhuan rhymes has already emerged by the early 12 th century, as proved by a study of Hangzhou dialect developed after the migration of the Southern Song Dynasty, and data from Sino-Khitan transcription.',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2016.0006',\n","  'Peter Jenks',\n","  'A Grammar Of Zoulei, Southwest China by Xia Li, Jinfang Li, and Yongxian Luo (review)',\n","  2016,\n","  '1. OVERVIEW Zoulei, literally Red Gelao, is a language in the Gelao ( ) dialect cluster of Kra (Mandarin Geyang, ), which itself is a major branch of the Kra-Dai family (Ostapirat 2000). Zoulei is also known as Bigong, a toponym based on the name of the village in Guizhou Province where it is spoken. Like many Kra languages, Zoulei is severely endangered: only 368 people live in the village of Bigong, and in their book Li, Li, and Luo (2014) report that of those less than 30 individuals are fluent speakers of the language, all over the age of 60. Moreover, Kra is the least described branch of Kra-Dai, and this is the first full-length published grammar of any Kra language. With these considerations, the publication of A Grammar of Zoulei is an important contribution for Kra-Dai studies. This grammar was based on the dissertation of Xia Li under the supervision of Jifang Li at Minzu University. Professor Jifang Li had previously collaborated with the third author, Yongxian Luo, on The Buyang language of south China: grammatical notes, glossary, texts and translations in 2010 (Li and Luo 2010, see also Li and Luo 2006).

Following Norman and Mei (1976), Li maintains (2015, 224) that “There is linguistic evidence that the Austroasiatics inhabited the Yangtze delta and parts of the southeast coast [of China] during the first half of the first millennium B.C.” Regardless of how one regards the claim that modern forms of Min show traces of early borrowing from AA languages, these surely were not the only languages in southern China before political unification under Qin Shi Huang in the 3 century BC initiated the southward expansion of the Han Chinese. Hmong-Mien languages are indigenous to the lower Yangtze region, and Kra-Dai languages have been in southern China since the earliest Chinese records. We have no idea how many other language families were among the ‘Hundred Yue’, which have since become absorbed and lost to history, but given the present linguistic picture, and the known process of sinicization in recent centuries, we have every reason to believe that southern China was linguistically more diverse in 6,000 BC than it is today.

Therefore, the second personal pronoun er evolves into na , and the vacancy of the third personal pronoun can only be filled in with other pronouns which have nothing to do with proximal or distal demonstrative pronouns. Because of the mental distance of the referent of the third person concept and the historically later appearance of K series of distal demonstrative pronouns in the southeast dialects, the pronouns of the “other demonstrative” type ta and qi of specific reference similar in sound to the N series and the K series evolve into the third personal pronouns in the two categories of dialects. The concept of the third personal pronoun in northwest dialects corresponds to that of proximal deixis and distal deixis, and because its referent is mentally far, the distal demonstrative pronoun wu/na is used for the third personal pronoun as well.

To answer this question, Myers-Scotton’s (2002) Matrix Language Frame model was tested with Southern Min/Mandarin code-switched data. The results showed that the two criteria (i.e. the morpheme order principle and the system morpheme principle) proposed to identify the matrix language in this model were found inapplicable. This is because Southern Min and Mandarin share most of their morphosyntactic structure and have a limited amount of inflectional morphology. To solve this theoretical problem, one supporting theory of the matrix language frame model (i.e. the uniform structure principle) and other possible criteria were also tested, but they were not successful. With the re-introduction of an additional criterion (i.e. the morpheme counting principle) to identify the matrix language, this study proposes a revised version of the matrix language frame model which was applied to re-analyze the Southern Min/Mandarin code-switched data. The results show that the matrix languages of 92.63% of the Southern Min/Mandarin bilingual clauses (340 in total) were unambiguously identified. This suggests that unlike the original model, the revised version of the matrix language frame model is able to cover a wider range of code-switched data (i.e. bothtypologically similar and different language pairs). With the empirical success of the original matrix language frame model reported in the previous literature and the success of additional principle proposed to particularly analyse code-switched data of a typologically similar language pair (Southern Min and Mandarin), this study argues that the revised version of the matrix language frame model is universally applicable. 提要: 本研究之目的在于寻找一个能适用于各种不同语言特性之语码转换 (code-switching)理论。为达此目的, 我们利用普通话及闽南话之语码 转换语料, 来测试 Myers-Scotton (2002)所提出的「主体语结构模式理 论 (The Matrix Language Frame Model)」。但测试结果发现, 该理论中 用来确认主体语的两项指标: 「词序原则 (the morpheme order principle)」及「系统词素原则 (the system morpheme principle)」皆无法 适用于普通话及闽南话的转换语料。由于此两种语言在句法结构上有 极高的相似性, 且在屈折型态学 (inflectional morphology)上的特性亦不 明显, 因而凸显出该理论无法处理句法、型态相似的语码转换语料的 缺陷。本研究尝试采用结构一致性原则 (the uniform structure principle) 及其他的替代方案, 但都无法有效确认普通话及闽南话转换语料的主 体语。因此, 我们在该理论的原有基础上稍做修正, 加入另一个确认 主体语的指标: 「词素计算原则 (the morpheme counting principle)」来 分析相同语料。分析结果显示: 在总数 340 个包含普通话及闽南话的 双语子句中, 有 92. 63%的子句之主体语能被清楚确认。由于现有的文 献指出, 原有的「主体语结构模式理论」已成功通过许多在句法、型 态上差异性大的语码转换语料的检测, 本研究所提出的修正版本更强 化了该理论, 使其亦能涵盖语言结构具高度相似性的语料。因此, 我 们认为本研究所提出「主体语结构模式理论」修正版本, 可适用于各 种不同语言所构成的语码转换语料。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2016.0008',\n","  'Laurent Sagart',\n","  'Liangdao Man and Austronesian origins',\n","  2016,\n","  'The discovery of Liangdao Man, a skeleton C-14 dated to c. 6000 BCE, under a shell mound in Liang Island north of the Taiwan strait, and the sequencing by Ko et al.

Liangdao man’s mtDNA belongs to a very early form of haplogroup E, which is exclusively Austronesian and well represented in Taiwan in two forms: E1 and E2. In JCL 43.1A (2015), Paul Li discusses the “implications for the pre-Austronesian homeland” of the discovery of Liangdao man. Li’s assumptions are these: on the ground of morphological arguments in Reid (1994), he accepts the view that Austronesian and Austroasiatic are sister branches of ‘Austric’. A critique of these morphological arguments can be found in Kaufman (2013). Li also accepts the arguments of Norman and Mei (1976) for an Austroasiatic presence on the southeast China coast. See however Sagart (2008) for a critique of their lexical arguments. Based on these assumptions Li supposes that unitary Austric was spoken on the southeast China coast and that Liangdao man spoke Austric (‘an Austric’, p. 228). Li correctly reports the finding by Ko et al. that Liangdao Man’s mtDNA is the ancestral form of all Formosan E1 haplotypes. He is silent, however, on the origin of Haplogroup E: according to Ko et al., haplogroup E developed out of haplogroup M9 on the southeast China coast near Fuzhou 福州 c. 8,136–10,933 years ago.

The results showed that: 1) The aerodynamic features of initials vary among different speakers, which might be attributed to their gender or articulation habits. Male speakers have higher air-pressure, airflow peak and expiratory volume (EV) than females, which might be attributed to a greater lung capacity of the male. 2) Aspirated consonants have higher sound pressure level (SPL), expiratory airflow duration (EAD), peak air-pressure (PAP), peak expiratory airflow (PEA) and EV than their unaspirated counterparts.

Chinese VV Compounds’ identical morpho-syntactic structure represents different event relations between the two component words and the correct interpretation of the meaning of these compounds relies on the prediction on their event relations. Without overt syntactic clues, we propose that ontology-based conceptual classification can be used to predict the event relation between the two component words. Compounding is the most productive way to research multi-word expressions in Mandarin Chinese. A Mandarin VV compound can be classified according to the eventive relation between two simplex verbs, which specifies how the eventive meanings of the two simplex verbs combine to form the meaning of the compound. The way in which two events combine with each other depends upon their event types, and the three types of eventive relations that we deal with in this paper are coordinate, modificational, and resultative. Using an ontology-based prediction approach, we hypothesized that the eventive relations could be predicted by the conceptual classification of the two simplex verbs’ event types. First, we utilized SUMO and Sinica BOW to classify each simplex verb. Next, the correlation between the ontology-based classification of each verb position and each eventive type was scored using a manually tagged lexical database and a training set was established. Finally, we encoded the ontological information of each VV compound in a 3-tuple based on these correlation scores. This 3-tuple was represented as a three-dimensional vector and was used to predict the eventive type of the new VV compounds.

This model was based on the data of MRI images and X-ray movie, with the former providing detailed volumetric information of the vocal tract, and the latter the dynamic information of articulation. In this model, the seven articulators have been studied and modeled, including the hard palate, pharynx, jaw, lips, velum, tongue, and larynx. The tongue is modeled as two parts: tongue tip and tongue body, thus reducing the necessary number of parameters. The relation between larynx height and fundamental frequency in regard to the four tones is also modeled. These two improvements on tongue and larynx modeling have contributed new ideas to the articulatory modeling of Standard Chinese.

In order to simulate the behavior of the articulatory apparatus, computational modeling is a commonly-used method. We have constructed a full 3D physiological articulatory model that includes the tongue, jaw, hyoid bone and vocal-tract wall based on the continuum finite element method. This model comprises articulatory muscles with realistic properties and geometrical arrangements. The muscle activation patterns are used to control the movements of the model. In order to use the model to investigate the speech motor control mechanism, generate speech sounds, predict the effect of surgical operation, etc., we have to realize an automatic control strategy. The task of the control strategy is given a particular target, how to generate muscle activation patterns that can control the model to achieve the target. There are two main control strategies for the physiological articulatory model: feedforward control and feedback control. Feedforward control is a kind of mapping used to directly find muscle activation patterns according to the desired target, and feedback control is used to adjust muscle activation patterns to reduce the distance between the desired target and the realized position. In speech production, feedforward mapping is used to rapidly generate muscle activation patterns to control the articulators to produce fluent speech. Feedback control plays the role of learning and maintaining the feedforward mapping. When the degree of accuracy using feedforward mapping cannot satisfy the requirement, feedback control can be used to realize fine motor control. In this paper, we describe how to use feedback control as a learning loop to construct feedforward mapping. The constructed feedforward mapping was assessed through an open-set test, and reasonable articulatory positions were obtained by comparison with the desired targets. Furthermore, the ability of feedback control to improve control accuracy was proved by a large quantity of simulations. 提要: 在言語產生的過程中,發音器官是執行來自中樞神經系統的運動指令的 終端組織。電腦建模的方法常常被應用於模擬發音器官的行為。為此, 我們使用連續體有限元的方法建立了一個三維的發音器官的生理模型, 該模型包含舌、下頜、舌骨以及聲道壁等發音器官。該模型還包括了根 據其生理解剖屬性建立的用於控制發音器官運動的肌肉模型。為了將該 生理模型應用於探索發音器官的運動控制機制,產生自然流暢的語音, 對發音器官的手術後功能進行預測等,我們需要對模型建立一個自動的 控制機制。控制機制的任務在於給定一個發音目標,如何自動的產生肌 肉激活模式去控制模型到達目標。對於發音器官的生理模型而言,有兩 種主要的控制方式:前饋控制和回饋控制。前饋控制是一種從發音控制 目標到肌肉激活模式的映射,用於根據發音目標產生肌肉激活模式;而 回饋控制主要用於調整肌肉激活模式來減少模型實現的位置到目標之間 的距離,最終控制模型到達目標。在言語產生的過程中,前饋控制用於 快速的產生肌肉激活模式控制發音器官產生流暢的語音。回饋控制主要 用於學習前饋控制的映射,並且維持前饋控制可行性。當前饋控制的精 度不能滿足需求時,回饋控制可以用於提高控制精度以實現精確控制。 在本文中,我們將重點介紹如何使用回饋控制作為學習回路,建立前饋 控制的映射。對已建立的前饋映射的開集測試表明該映射可以用於控制 模型在誤差允許範圍內達到目標。而且,大量的模型模擬表明回饋控制 可用於改善前饋控制的控制精度。',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2015.0025',\n","  'Wang Feng',\n","  'Multisyllabication and Phonological Simplification Throughout Chinese History',\n","  2015,\n","  'Most combinations of morphemes in early Chinese are generative. Therefore, the morpheme is the basic grammatical unit. In other words, morphemes and words are not distinguishable in early Chinese. In modern Chinese, however, combinations of morphemes may be generative or non-generative. Morphemes in non-generative combinations are not basic units but rather constituents of basic units. From an evolutionary perspective, the basic units of the Chinese language developed from a single tier (morpheme/word) to a double tier (morpheme and word) constitution (Wang 2015). Interestingly, some researchers have correlated monosyllabic to multisyllabic 1 change, phonological simplification, and language contact. Scholars like Wang (1958) hypothesized that the latter two cause the syllabic change. Conversely, Zhang (1939) argued that the simplification of phonology does not cause an increase of homophones if the vocabulary is limited. He suggested that the great lexical expansion during the Western Zhou dynasty and the Spring and Autumn period activated multisyllabication. Additionally, Lu (1963) supported this theory based on twentieth-century observations of a significant increase of disyllabic words that were void of preceding phonological changes.',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2015.0028',\n","  'Yinghao Li',\n","  'Prosodic boundaries effect on segment articulation in standard Chinese: An articulatory and acoustic study',\n","  2015,\n","  'This paper presents an electropalatographic (EPG) and acoustic study of prosodic boundaries effect on the domain-initial segments in Standard Chinese. Two speech sounds, namely, the voiceless unaspirated alveolar stop /t/ and the high front vowel /i/, were studied to examine the domain-initial strengthening in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The articulatory and acoustic parameters of the speech sounds were compared in initial positions of five prosodic constituents in Standard Chinese, namely, a Syllable, a Foot, an Immediate Phrase, an Intonational Phrase, and an Utterance. The results show that: (1) the production of the domain-initial consonantal gesture was prosodically encoded. The linguopalatal contact and the seal duration varied as a function of the prosodic boundary strength. The linguopalatal contact was dependent on the seal duration in a nonlinear fashion. Of the acoustic properties of the domain-initial stop, the total voiceless interval and voicing during closure were found to be reliable acoustic correlates that mark the hierarchical structure of the prosody. (2) At the release moment of the domain-initial stop, no consistent pattern was found to support the domain-initial strengthening. The linguopalatal contact of the vowel immediately following the domain-initial consonant did not show a clear trend of domain-initial strengthening; however, the phonatory features of vowels were indicative of pitch reset at major prosodic boundaries. These indicate that the domain-initial strengthening is restricted on the segment immediately following the boundary. In conclusion Standard Chinese strengthens the phonetic features of the domain-initial segments as a function of boundary strength, which serves as an important way to mark prosodic structure in Standard Chinese.',\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2015.0000',\n","  'Xianming Bei',\n","  'The tone pattern in dialect contact',\n","  2015,\n","  'The features of tones contact have been investigated between Xiang Dialect and Gan Dialect, by using the method of tone pattern in this paper.

Due to the relatively shorter histories of contact languages as compared to ‘normal’ languages, semantic changes in contact languages are far better understood, thereby presenting us with case studies of polysemous words where contact-induced change and regular semantic change can be better demarcated. Studying such phenomena will thus shed light on the cognitive processes behind semantic change. This paper looks at how language use shapes the semantic pathway of Singapore Southern Min loanword balu and suggests that the findings in this paper can be applied cross-linguistically to other cases of regular semantic change. Singapore Colloquial Malay adverb baru ‘recently’ was borrowed into Singapore Southern Min as balu ‘recently’. Although Southern Min balu and Malay baru both share a common function, they exhibit disparate semantic pathways. Data gathered shows that loanword balu ‘recently’ has no tendency to develop a conjunctive function similar to that of Singapore Colloquial Malay and baru ‘recently’ has no tendency to develop another adverbial function like that of balu ‘recently’ in Singapore Southern Min. Initial findings of this paper suggest that the contrasting semantic pathways for Southern Min balu ‘recently’ and Malay baru ‘recently’ are due to differences in semantic fields a particular word is most strongly associated.

In this paper, based on EGG signals, three parameters, namely F0, Open Quotient (OQ) and Speed Quotient (SQ), are extracted to examine the tonal quality. It is found that there are two non-modal phonation types, Harsh and Pressed, and roughly four groups of pitch pattern (31/31/41; 33/433; 55/54; 35) in the eight tonal categories. One pair of tones can only be distinguished from each other by phonation type since their pitches are the same. As for other pairs, both pitch and phonation type may contribute to the distinction between them. Notably, non-modal phonation types vary across different Bai speakers. For a particular non-modal tone, one speaker may employ harsh voice, while another may use pressed voice. Sometimes, the non-modal phonation type even changed within a syllable. It is then suggested that different strategies may be used to produce non-modal tones in contrast with their modal counterpart. Moreover, based on the Bai data, how to define different phonation types based on the three basic parameters, F0, OQ and SQ, is discussed.

In such a situation, satisfaction of the melody would result in incomprehensibility of language. The reverse is equally devastating since then song would be totally superfluous. Nonetheless, a survey of Mandarin songs indicates that linguistic tones are often not faithfully preserved in tune, consequently giving rise to the question on how listeners are able to decipher the words that are sung.

The verb meaning ‘to give’ used as an agent marker is a generalizable phenomenon; the key step that gei can mark the passive is the connection between its original verb meaning (‘to give’) and its causative function. Causative verbs actually constitute one of the common sources of passive markers in Chinese. This phenomenon is attested in both Southern dialects and in non-Han languages. As to why gei in Mandarin Chinese can be both an agent marker and an object marker, semantic and lexical reasons were presented to show that these kinds of verbs are susceptible to development in a contrary direction (‘to give’ or ‘to receive’) as ‘to take’ in English (Take him another book, take=give.

However, in the northwestern Chinese dialect of Linxia, it will be shown below that in fact the opposite is true: the Linxia dialect consistently retains certain native phonological and lexical features, while undergoing heavy interference in syntax. In this paper three examples illustrating the nature and extent of contact- induced change in the Linxia dialect are examined. In Section 1 the morphemes for ‘small, little’ of the region’s languages are compared as an illustration of extensive lexicosemantic diffusion resulting in areal convergence. In Section 2 it is concluded that the co-existing markers of the comitative/ instrumental in Linxia represent two different types of borrowing: one, a calque on a compound numeral of the Mongolic languages of the region, and the other an outright loan from Mongolic of the Proto-Altaic comitative suffix *-lū. Finally, as an example of significant syntactic and phonological reanalysis, in Section 3 the Linxia postpositional conditional marker -Ȓȕ is examined. We conclude that this is the result of the combination of certain social and linguistic factors, and that social factors, such as political dominance, may well be the primary determinants of change 2 .

The two-verb causative constructions are divided into three types: those that cannot take conjunction hō 'in order that', those that take it obligatorily, and those that take it optionally. The etymon hō is also used as a verb and the dative case marker. Constructions using hō in such functions are also regarded as causative constructions since their meanings fit our semantic definition of the intentional causative construction.\",\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['',\n","  'Jerry Norman',\n","  'The initials of proto-min',\n","  1974,\n","  'The author in a prior article proposed a reconstruction of the stops and sonorants of Proto-Min.

The idea of convening a meeting to present and discuss papers bearing on the ultimate genetic relationship of Chinese to the Tibeto-Burman languages developed naturally in the course of several conversations held at Yale in 1967-68 among Samuel Martin, Roy Andrew Miller, Hugh Stimson, and myself. One of the chief motivations for this enterprise was the emergence from linguistic retirement of the pioneer Sino Tibetanist Paul K. Benedict. Benedict had abandoned linguistics for psychiatry in the 1940's, after having compiled (in collaboration with Robert Shafer, and under the overall direction of Alfred Kroeber) a vast compendium of everything that was then known about Tibeto-Burman, working out the basic sound-correspondences among the languages in the various subgroups of the family. 1 In addition, he had proposed a radical new genetic grouping for the languages of Southeast Asia,2 removing Thai and its relatives from Sino-Tibetan entirely, and grouping them rather with Malayo-Polynesian in a new group which he now calls Austro-Thai.3\",\n","  'Journal of Chinese Linguistics'],\n"," ['',\n","  'Mantaro J.
