Lizu has been argued to have a hybrid prosodic system combining lexical tone on monosyllabic words and prominence patterns with stress-like and tonal characteristics on polysyllabic words, although empirical evidence is lacking. This study presents an acoustic investigation of the pitch patterns on disyllabic words in the Kala variety of Lizu (HL, HH, LH). Using the parameters of duration, intensity, and f0, it attempts to sort out different forms of prominence, and to explore their interaction with lexical tone. The measurements are taken from experimental data with eight Lizu speakers (4 male and 4 female). The acoustic results and statistical analyses suggest that the first syllable in Kala Lizu is the position of prominence in all three pitch patterns. Our results are consistent with interpreting the pitch pattern HL as more stress-like (with intensity as an acoustic correlate of stress) and the pitch patterns HH and LH as more tone-like (with stress cued by full realization of lexical tone). This study contributes to a better understanding of the prosodic organization of Kala Lizu and it also suggests methodology for further exploration of other Lizu varieties.

https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2017.0138,Hsin‐I Hsieh,The idea of an indigenous chinese grammar,2023,"As Chinese linguistics encounters a more developed general linguistics, two opposite reactions emerged. One is to learn and imitate, while the other is to learn and innovate. As a visionary, William S-Y. Wang (1999) innovates. He rejected purely formal theories such as the Generative Grammar and envisioned an Indigenous Chinese Grammar (ICG) that takes culture into consideration. Echoing Wang’s seminal vision, we offer a possible ICG. We focus on the perplexing pair of cai2 才 (‘necessary’) and jiu4 就 (‘sufficient’). Both cai2 and jiu4 have divergent meanings that may be closely related, well related, remotely related, or even dubiously related. (See for example, you3qian2 cai2 jia4 ta1 ‘Marry him only if he is rich’, ta1 cai2 lai2 ‘He has just come’, wo3 cai2 you3qian2 ‘I am the one that has money’, wo3 cai2 bu2 pao4 ne0 ‘I contrary to anybody’s expectation am not afraid’.) Traditional formal theories seem unable to explain this wide range of divergence. But an Emergent Grammar (EG) can. Given a composition, EG enables its two elements to ‘interact’ into a largely unpredictable result. Free interactions in a specific context produce flexible results, making the derived meanings often unpredictable, as one would expect from a Complex system as opposed to a Complicated system. Realized as a complex-systematic approach to Chinese grammar, Wang’s brilliant insight of ICG could well inspire and help launch a fresh advancement path in Chinese linguistics.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

South Coblin,GUTTURAL FRICATIVES AND INITIAL *w- IN COMMON MǏN,2023,"In his earlier Proto-Mǐn reconstructed phonological system the late Professor Jerry Norman posited three guttural fricative initials, i.e., *x-, *h-, and *-h-. In early unpublished manuscripts dealing with this system, *x- was classed as velar, while *h- and *-h- were described as laryngeals. Initial *x- was characterized as voiceless and *h- and *-h- as voiced. In Norman (1974), however, *h- was transcribed as phonetic [ɣ], a voiced velar (rather than laryngeal) fricative, while *-h- was interpreted as [ɦ], a voiced laryngeal. In his much more recent Common Mǐn system, as represented in certain of his final dialectological publications and posthumous papers, Norman posited one voiceless velar fricative, *x-, and two laryngeals, *h-, and *ɦ-, the former voiceless and the latter voiced. Additionally, he reconstructed a rounded semivowel, Common Mǐn *w-, which had not been explicitly mentioned in his published presentations of Proto-Mǐn but was posited without comment in manuscript materials in a single word, i.e., huáng 黃 “yellow”. In the Common Mǐn system, on the other hand, this *w- plays a more prominent role and is also associated with the guttural fricatives in certain ways. The purpose of the present paper is to exemplify and compare Norman’s new Common Mǐn *x-, *h-, *ɦ-, and *w-.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

An overview of the conceptual history of the term and of the competing etymologies of yǎ in early Chinese texts is offered in order to problematize this “invented tradition” and its ideological baggage. Four types of evidence (uniformity of phonology and syntax in excavated texts, ode citation practices, phonophoric repair by double phonophoric characters, lexical variation) are then presented and their usefulness to support an early written standard of elite inter-communication is discussed. Straightforward creolization and mixed language accounting for the emergence of Old Chinese are rejected. Instead, a scenario of interrupted language transmission in a highly diverse linguistic Sprachbund area is sketched and argued to best account for the observed asymmetries between a high degree of early lexical and orthographical variation (including substrate influences) on the one hand, and phonological and syntactic uniformity of texts from geographically diverse areas on the other.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

AUTONOMOUS SYNTAX AND INTERFACE INTERACTION When Chomsky set up the generative grammar theory framework in the 1950s, he made it clear that the same set of rules and structural representations, which he called universal grammar (UG), provide the basis for the individual grammar of every language (Chomsky 1957). The ultimate goal for establishing generative grammar is to figure out what these rules are and how they work. As means to achieve his goal, Chomsky gave up the fundamental assumptions of structuralism and divided language studies into modules such as syntax, semantics, phonetics, phonology and so on. His intention is to study each module independently without referring to the others and a new term “autonomous syntax” is created to convey this idea, illustrated by the well-known sentence “colorless green ideas sleep furiously”. He admits that this sentence is semantically absurd but insists that it is syntactically well-formed and Acknowledgements This paper is an output of the NSSFC Project “Studies of Chinese in Generative Grammar and Innovation of Grammatical Theory (18ZDA291)”.

The research conducted along the line of autonomy of syntax and other modules made tremendous progress in the past sixty and so years, generated an enormous amount of literature and brought linguistic science to an all-time height. At the same time, some hidden problems emerged gradually and one of them is related to the autonomy of syntax. To segment language into independent modules is in a sense an adaption of a common practice in scientific research and naturally inherits the shortcomings of such practice. A natural language is the means of describing the world and conveying thoughts for its speakers and it always works as a whole. Taking the language apart makes it easier to analyze its individual modules but also makes it harder to understand the interaction between modules. Chomsky’s solution to this problem is to evoke interface operations, which are supposed to involve two or more modules, The original assumption is that interface operations bring the product of one module into another module. When a structure reaches Sstructure as the final product of syntax, the structure is pure syntactical and will have to go across to PF to get pronunciation or to LF to get semantic interpretation. This leads to the famous upside-down Y-shape model of syntax (Chomsky 1981, 1982) and its later versions. The interface idea leads to quite a number of break-throughs and the most influential one in the GB era is perhaps the LF-movement of Chinese wh-in-situ (Huang 1982). An important assumption of formal syntax is that the sentenceinitial wh-phrase of a question in English or French is generated in a different position determined by its syntactic-semantic relation with the predicate and is then moved to its final position according to syntactic rules. The Chinese wh-phrases pose a challenge to this line of analysis in that they do not move in syntax but have almost the same scope properties like their English counterparts. This loophole was fixed when Huang put forward his interface operation analysis, assuming Chinese wh-in-situs also undergo movement to get the correct interpretation like their English counterparts and the only difference is that Chinese wh-in-situs move at LF. The mechanism of interface interaction is also invoked to analyze some phenomena occurring between D-structure and S-structure, and the best-known case is the analysis of certain in-situ English wh-words.

This Insight article argues for the unselective binding approach to this particular type of donkey sentences by alluding to quantificational reflexive doubling.

In the Chinese lexicon there are changeable and unchangeable verbs distinguished by the latter’s inability to co-occur with aspect particles in a finite clause. The changeable declaratives are further divided into two kinds: durational and nondurational, as the latter cannot occur alone without either the perfective le1 in realis, or a modal auxiliary. Moreover, the durational declaratives can occur in either irrealis modality negated by bù or realis modality negated by měi(yǒu). The declarative sentences for durational events are linguistically distinct in terms of telicity: the progressive zài and imperfective zhe are atelic, and the perfective le1 and experiential guo are telic. Just like other world languages as was noted by Givón (1995, 2001), Chinese finiteness is also characteristically gradient, with the least finite forms functioning like a noun and the most finite forms functioning as a declarative sentence with an obligatory aspect particle.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Although theoretical studies show that there is a covert dependency between the in-situ question word/phrase and SpecCP, little is known how this dependency is evidenced in the processing of Mandarin wh-in-situ questions. In addition, bare Mandarin wh-phrases like shéi 'who' are different from complex ones like nǎge tóngxué 'which classmate', as the former are known as wh-indeterminates, on a par with indefinites (Cheng 1991), while the latter are considered on a par with definites (Rullmann and Beck 1998). To uncover the processing mechanism of wh-in-situ questions, we conducted two self-paced reading studies where we compared their processing behavior with that of their declarative counterparts. Specifically, and due to the claims made in the literature regarding the nature of bare and complex wh-questions, we compared bare wh-questions with declarative counterparts that contained indefinites, and complex wh-questions with declarative counterparts that contained definites. Our findings show that, regardless of their bare or complex nature, wh-questions were in general processed with more cost (i.e., reading delay) than their declarative counterparts, providing evidence that a covert-dependency is built in wh-questions. In particular, based on our results we claim that after reading the core whelement, the parser immediately starts the process of resolving the wh-question interpretation by establishing the covert dependency.摘要:汉语普通话的特殊疑问句是在位疑问句，即疑问词的位置和陈述句对应名词的位置相同(例如""约翰买了什么？"")，并不移到句首。理论语言学的研究表明，在位的疑问词与句子左缘的 SpecCP 存在隐性的依存关系，但这种依存关系能否从在线句子加工中找到证据，尚不得而知。除此之外，光杆疑问词(例如""谁"")与复杂的疑问词(例如""哪个同学"")本质不同，因为前者是 wh-不定指，类似于不定代词 (Cheng 1991), 而后者性质与有定代词类似 (Rullmann and Beck, 1998)。为了更好地揭示普通话特殊疑问句的加工机制，文章进行了两个自控步速阅读实验，来对比疑问句和对应陈述句的加工模式。具体说来，根据文献中对光杆疑问词和复杂疑问词的区分，我们分别对比了光杆疑问句和包含了对应不定代词陈述句的加工区别，以及复杂疑问句和包含了对应有定代词陈述句的加工区别。研究结果表明，尽管疑问词的性质有光杆和复杂之分，疑问句整体上都要比对应陈述句加工成本更高 (即需要更多的加工时间) 。这为普通话特殊疑问句中隐性依存关系的建构提供了在线加工上的证据。此外，实验的结果显示，只要阅读到 wh-成分 (例如""哪个""、""谁"") ，被试就开始了疑问依存关系的建构，不需要读完整个词组 (例如""哪个同学"")。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Bauer,Challenging issues in cantonese-english lexicography,2023,"At the outset of writing a bilingual Cantonese-English dictionary that is comprehensive in scope, the lexicographer confronts a series of challenging issues that are fundamental to the successful creation of such an ambitious dictionary. Among the crucial questions to be satisfactorily resolved are at least the following eight: 1) What are the principal criteria that guide the lexicographer’s selection of the Cantonese lexical items that form the contents of the bilingual dictionary? Further, what is the scope of the lexical contents? Broad, by encompassing all lexical items that occur in the speech of Hong Kong Cantonese speakers, even those items that overlap with standard Chinese? Or, narrow, by focusing only on the uniquely Hong Kong Cantonese lexicon? 2) What categories of information about the lexical items should form the structural contents of lexical entries? These could include parts of speech, speech registers, cross-referencing of related lexical items, synonyms, alternative pronunciations and variant written forms, example sentences, etc. 3) How detailed should the equivalent English translations of the Cantonese lexical items be? 4) Should lexical entries include information on their social, cultural, historical, and political associations, usage, etymology (origin and historical development), etc.? 5) What is the organizing principle by which the Cantonese lexical entries are listed in the dictionary, as there are at least four? 6) As for Cantonese pronunciation, which register of the language should be romanized? The conservative, literary, standard pronunciation? The colloquial, informal, commonly-used 懶 音 laan5 jam1 “lazy” pronunciation? Or both of these? 7) Several Cantonese romanization systems are currently in use, so which one is best for representing Hong Kong’s contemporary Cantonese pronunciation? 8) Given that the written form of the Cantonese language has never been formally or officially standardized, so that some lexical items are typically written in two or more different ways, what criteria should guide the lexicographer in deciding how Cantonese words are graphically transcribed in a Cantonese-English dictionary? In writing his ABC Cantonese-English Comprehensive Dictionary 粵語英語大詞典 (Bauer 2020) over the past decade and a half, the author had to face and then answer appropriately each of these important questions. This article has described how he addressed and practically resolved these and other related problems.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1353/jcl.2017.0139,Zhongwei Shen,Understanding the qieyun rhymes,2023,"This article shows that the Qieyun rhymes are not necessarily different VC units (VC = vowel and ending), as initially defined by Karlgren in his work Études sur la phonologie chinoise (1915–1926). Karlgren’s mistake creates a serious problem in the reconstruction of the vowel system of Middle Chinese. In the proposed reconstructions so far, excessive vocalic distinctions are required. This problem is well acknowledged but no explanations and solutions have been convincingly provided. Based on the information from the poetry rhyming before and at the same time of the Qieyun, our analyses of the Qieyun rhymes with the -ŋ ending indicate that 1) not all the Qieyun rhymes are different VCs, and 2) some Qieyun rhymes are the preservation of historical categories. With the new understanding of the nature of the Qieyun rhymes, the required main vowels of Middle Chinese can be significantly reduced. The twelve Qieyun rhymes with -ŋ require only six main vowels. The observation that not all the Qieyun rhymes are different VCs can be supported by the recent distribution analyses of the Qieyun rhymes. A fundamental viewpoint of this article is that in the study of the phonological history of Chinese, what should be reconstructed is the phonological system of Middle Chinese instead of the so-called “Qieyun system”. Because the phonological categories contained in the Qieyun are neither synchronically systematic nor phonologically consistent, the Qieyun does not represent a single phonological system of any historical period in the phonological history of Chinese.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

By Yafei Li. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2022. Pp. xviii, 310. ISBN 9781108885935 (ebook) 1. AUTONOMOUS SYNTAX AND INTERFACE INTERACTION When Chomsky set up the generative grammar theory framework in the 1950s, he made it clear that the same set of rules and structural representations, which he called universal grammar (UG), provide the basis for the individual grammar of every language (Chomsky 1957). The ultimate goal for establishing generative grammar is to figure out what these rules are and how they work. As means to achieve his goal, Chomsky gave up the fundamental assumptions of structuralism and divided [End Page 247] language studies into modules such as syntax, semantics, phonetics, phonology and so on. His intention is to study each module independently without referring to the others and a new term ""autonomous syntax"" is created to convey this idea, illustrated by the well-known sentence ""colorless green ideas sleep furiously"". He admits that this sentence is semantically absurd but insists that it is syntactically well-formed and could be studied on its own. The research conducted along the line of autonomy of syntax and other modules made tremendous progress in the past sixty and so years, generated an enormous amount of literature and brought linguistic science to an all-time height. At the same time, some hidden problems emerged gradually and one of them is related to the autonomy of syntax. To segment language into independent modules is in a sense an adaption of a common practice in scientific research and naturally inherits the shortcomings of such practice. A natural language is the means of describing the world and conveying thoughts for its speakers and it always works as a whole. Taking the language apart makes it easier to analyze its individual modules but also makes it harder to understand the interaction between modules. Chomsky's solution to this problem is to evoke interface operations, which are supposed to involve two or more modules. The original assumption is that interface operations bring the product of one module into another module. When a structure reaches S-structure as the final product of syntax, the structure is pure syntactical and will have to go across to PF to get pronunciation or to LF to get semantic interpretation. This leads to the famous upside-down Y-shape model of syntax (Chomsky 1981, 1982) and its later versions. The interface idea leads to quite a number of break-throughs and the most influential one in the GB era is perhaps the LF-movement of Chinese wh-in-situ (Huang 1982). An important assumption of formal syntax is that the sentence-initial wh-phrase of a question in English or French is generated in a different position determined by its syntactic-semantic relation with the predicate and is then moved to its final position according to syntactic rules. The Chinese wh-phrases pose a challenge to this line of analysis in that they do not move in syntax but have almost the same scope properties like their English counterparts. This loophole was fixed when Huang put forward his interface operation analysis, assuming Chinese wh-in-situs also [End Page 248] undergo movement to get the correct interpretation like their English counterparts and the only difference is that Chinese wh-in-situs move at LF. The mechanism of interface interaction is also invoked to analyze some phenomena occurring between D-structure and S-structure, and the best-known case is the analysis of certain in-situ English wh-words. When who bought what is understood as a direct question, what can have wide scope even though it stays in-situ, and the question should be replied with a paired answer for the two wh-words, in the form of John bought a book or Mary bought a computer. This is apparently another loophole in the autonomous syntactic operation and any possible solution is not likely to come from the syntactic module alone. A solution by Pesetsky (1987) is that such a question is valid only in a particular discourse where each person in a group has purchased... ",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Chirkova; Angelique Amelot,Acoustic correlates of prominence in Kala Lizu (Tibeto-Burman),2023,"ABSTRACT:This study investigates acoustic correlates of prominence in Lizu (Tibeto-Burman). Lizu has been argued to have a hybrid prosodic system combining lexical tone on monosyllabic words and prominence patterns with stress-like and tonal characteristics on polysyllabic words, although empirical evidence is lacking. This study presents an acoustic investigation of the pitch patterns on disyllabic words in the Kala variety of Lizu (HL, HH, LH). Using the parameters of duration, intensity, and f0, it attempts to sort out different forms of prominence, and to explore their interaction with lexical tone. The measurements are taken from experimental data with eight Lizu speakers (4 male and 4 female). The acoustic results and statistical analyses suggest that the first syllable in Kala Lizu is the position of prominence in all three pitch patterns. Our results are consistent with interpreting the pitch pattern HL as more stress-like (with intensity as an acoustic correlate of stress) and the pitch patterns HH and LH as more tone-like (with stress cued by full realization of lexical tone). This study contributes to a better understanding of the prosodic organization of Kala Lizu and it also suggests methodology for further exploration of other Lizu varieties.摘要:本研究考察里汝语中韵律突显的声学相关物。里汝语曾被认为拥有一 种混合的韵律系统，结合了单音节词的声调，以及多音节词上的重音 似的和声调式的突显格局，尽管缺乏相关的实证证据。本研究对木里 县卡拉乡里汝语不同音高模式(HL、HH、LH)的双音节词进行了声学 考察，使用音长、音强和基频的参数，确定不同类型双音节词中的突 显形式，并探讨这些突显与词层面声调之间的相互关系。测量数据来 自 8 位里汝语母语者(4 男 4 女)的语音实验。声学结果和统计分析表 明，卡拉乡里汝语的全部三种音高模式中，第一个音节都处于突显位置，HL 类型的音高模式表现得更像重音(以音强为重音的声学相关物)， HH 和 LH 类型的音高模式表现得更像声调(以词调的完整实现来体现 重音)。这项研究有助于更好地理解里汝语的韵律结构，并为进一步探 索其他里汝语土语提供了方法。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Compared with Modern Chinese, Archaic Chinese seems to have a richer encoding for relative clauses. It has three possible relative markers: zhe, zhi and suo. In this article, we will approach to Archaic Chinese relatives from the perspective of formal syntax. We will argue that zhe is a subject relative pronoun and suo a VP internal relative pronoun, and that zhe- and suo-relatives are derived from the A'-movement of the relevant relative pronoun to the peripheral position, creating an operator-variable relation at LF. Simultaneously, we will use Cecchetto and Donati's labeling theory to account for a peculiar phenomenon that the same relative pronoun can form both headless and headed relatives. We will further argue that the relative marker zhi, as English that, is an invariant relativizer occupying the C position, and that zhi-relatives involve null operator movement. That is to say, like English type of languages, Archaic Chinese actually involves two separate relativizing strategies: through a relative pronoun or a null operator. The article also contributes to the debate on the analysis of relatives: data from Archaic Chinese favors an Adjunction Analysis to the Raising Analysis (or Complementation Analysis) à la Kayne.摘要:众所周知，现代汉语中所有的关系从句均由""的""引导。相比之下， 上古汉语中关系从句的表现形式则更为丰富，共有""者""""之""""所"" 三种关系化标记。本文将从形式句法的视角探讨上古汉语的上述三种 关系从句。我们认为""者""是主语关系代词，而""所""是VP内关系代 词，带""者""或""所""的关系从句是通过关系代词A'移动至边缘位置 而生成的，并借此在LF 层建立了算子–变量关系。同时，我们将采用 Cecchetto 和Donati 的加标理论来解释上古汉语中同一个关系代词既可 构成无核关系从句，又可构成有核关系从句这一奇特的语法现象。至 于关系化标记""之""，我们认为它与英语中的that 相似，是标句词C， 而""之""引导的关系从句则是通过空算子移位生成的。也就是说，上 古汉语和英语类语言一样，都具有两种独立的关系化策略，即要么通 过关系代词实现关系化，要么通过空算子实现关系化。另外，此文还 将对目前学界关于关系从句分析方法的争论起到一定的参考作用：上 古汉语的语料证明了嫁接分析法要优于Kayne 的提升(或称补语)分析 法。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

This paper concludes that:1. The Xiān (仙)/Xiān (先) distinction is indeed preserved in Modern Xiang, and the phonological contrast occurs after the initials of the Jing (精) series of Middle Chinese. 2. According to the phonetic representation in Modern Xiang, Xiān (仙) could be reconstructed as *-iɑn and Xiān (先) as *-ian. 3.

INSIGHT ON THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF PROSODY: A RESPONSE TO DUANMU’S RHYTHMIC ANALYSIS Shengli Feng Beijing Language and Culture University, Beijing The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong 1. WHAT IS RHYTHM: DUANMU’S ANALYSIS Rhythm is a fundamental notion in music, poetry, as well as the prosodic systems of human language. Though there have been rich discussions about what rhythm is and how it functions, it has taken until now to arrive at a general and precise definition of rhythm as in Duanmu (2022), which states as follows: (1) Definition of rhythm a. Rhythm is the repetition of a unit of alternation. b. A unit of alternation consists of two non-identical parts A and B. Based on the definition of rhythm, Duanmu (2022, 262) also develops a representation of poetic line as in (2) and that of poem as in (3). Acknowledgments I thank San Duanmu (端木三) and Yafei Li (李亚非) for their inspiring ideas, comments and suggestions in writing this paper. I also thank Qiuwu Ma (马秋武), Qi Gong (宫 齐), Zhiqiang Li (李智强), Wen Cao (曹文), Feng-fan Hsien (谢丰帆), Xiangdong Shi (施向东), Chunhong Shi (施春宏), and the anonymous reviewers for their comments. The arguments made here do not necessarily all agree with theirs.

Unit of repetition: a disyllabic trochaic foot b. Parts of alternation: A is a stressed syllable; B is an unstressed syllable. (3) Representation of a poem a. Unit of repetition: a poetic line b. Parts of alternation: A is a given number of feet; B is a boundary #. The arguments and the analyses offered by Duanmu are insightful and important. In general, whether in the East or in the West, the notion of rhythm and that of repetition are almost interchangeable. However, in poetry, as Duanmu points out, rhythm is organized by repetition of alternating units, and it operates in all languages at all levels too (see also Feng and Shi 2021). The new definition of rhythm makes a necessary and important correction on previous misunderstandings of what human rhythm involves. Duanmu (2022) also offers a judgment experiment on perceived rhythmicality of Chinese poems and discovers some rhythmic contrasts between riming and poem structure on the one hand, and shuāngshēng 双 声 ‘repeated adjacent onsets’, diéyùn 叠韵 ‘repeated adjacent rimes’, consonance, and assonance on the other. The former two have significant effects on perceived rhythmicality, while the latter four contribute little to this aspect. This study has far-reaching ramifications for future studies on rhythmic objects with their perceived rhythmicality. 2. DIFFERENT OPINIONS Although Duanmu’s (2022) analysis is insightful, there are some crucial points about the nature of rhythm which differ from Feng and Shi’s (2021) proposal, as summarized in Duanmu (2022, 271), repeated in (4). (4) Feng and Shi (2021, 42) distinguish rhythm in language and rhythm in nature: Rhythm in language (jiélǜ 节 律 ): The repetition unit contains an alternation. Rhythm in nature (jiézòu 节 奏 ): The repetition unit contains no alternation. ON BIOLOGICAL PROSODY 3 Duanmu (2022, 272) comments as follows: Feng and Shi (2021) are probably right to propose that there is a difference between rhythm in speech and rhythm in other things. However, the difference does not seem to lie in the lack of alternation in non-speech rhythms. For example, there is an alternation between beat and pause in drum beats, and there is an alternation between day and night in a daily cycle. We can, instead, distinguish speech rhythm and other rhythms by the units of alternation: In speech, the alternating units are phonological categories, such as syllables...

The results show that, compared to vowels and consonants, tones carry the smallest functional load. In tones that are associated with monosyllabic, bi-syllabic, and multi-syllabic words, the functional load is inversely related to the number of syllables in that word. In other words, the more syllables in a word, the further the functional load of tones tends to decrease. Importantly, this study reveals a close correlation between the functional load of Chinese tones and the evolution of these tones. This is evidenced by the perceived imbalance of the functional load of different tonal contrasts within contemporary Chinese, as well as by the simulation results of the drastically declining functional load of Chinese tones in diachronic. These results may suggest that the declining load of Chinese tones is indeed the underlying driver for the merger and the resulting decline in the number of Chinese tones.

The investigation of the distributions, grammatical properties and functions of -haa5 reveals that all usages of -haa5 are derived from its original meaning 'a stroke, a bit, or a tiny amount'. The distributions of -haa5 are highly restricted: predicates eligible to co-occur with -haa5 are verbs/adjectives with an innate event/degree argument, excluding those whose semantics are of extreme/polarity reading. The function of -haa5 is to delimit events when following verb phrases (henceforth VPs) and make slight adjustments of degree when attached to adjective phrases (henceforth APs). Moreover, -haa5 is of the function of subjectivity encoding. -Haa5 has been grammaticalized from a verb classifier, event delimiter/degree adjuster to a subjectivity marker and is syntactically at the left periphery of the extended projection of predicative lexical categories.摘要:""-吓""是粤语动词和形容词短语之后经常出现的一个后缀。通过对 ""-吓""的句法分布、语法性质和功能的研究，本文发现""-吓""的所 有用法都源自其""一下""的初始意义。""-吓""的句法分布非常受限： 能与""-吓""合法共现的谓词都是内含事件/程度论元的动词/形容词， 并且这些谓词不能包含极限/极项意义。当附着在动词短语之后时， ""-吓""的功能是切分事件，当它出现在形容词短语后时，其作用是 对形容词表达的程度意义进行细微调整。除此之外，""-吓""还能表达 说话者的主观判断。我们认为粤语的""-吓""已经完成了从动量词、事 件切分/程度调节成分到主观性标记的语法化，它在句法上处于谓词 性词汇短语扩展投射的左边界位置。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

A series of vowel rephonologization resulted from front vowel raised chain shift was characterized by the differentiation and merging of rhyme groups <i>Ge1</i> 歌1 <i>Ge3</i> 歌3, <i>Zhi</i> 支 <i>Ge2</i> 歌2, and <i>Zhi2</i> 脂2 <i>Zhi1</i> 脂1, which formed <i>Ma-Er</i> 麻二, <i>Jia</i> 佳, <i>Jie</i> 皆, <i>Ma-San</i> 麻三, <i>Zhi</i> 支, <i>Zhi</i> 脂, and <i>Qi</i> 齐 rhymes in the Middle Ancient with fronting and collaboration of rhyme groups <i>Wei1</i> 微1 <i>Wei2</i> 微2 and <i>Zhi</i> 之. As for the patterns in <i>Qieyun</i> 切韵 of rhymes, <i>Jia</i> 佳 and <i>Qi</i> 齐 were shaped in Liu Song Dynasty, while the formation of <i>Jie</i> 皆 rhyme was after the Liu Song, and the <i>Zhi</i> 支 and <i>Zhi</i> 脂 rhymes were not earlier than the Jin Dynasty. The form of front vowel raised chain shift is incomplete and belongs to localized chain shift. The structural adjustment of Chinese vowel system occurred after the start of the long vowel raising and before the completion of the short vowel lengthening.</p>",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The NP should be a direct time-denoting NPtime or an indirect time-denoting NPitime. Following Kayne (2016), we assume there is a silent TIME following de. Meanwhile, a less-discussed use of de—that is, the equational/appositional use of de (Chao 1968), has been revived to link the silent TIME and NPtime/NPitime. This analysis of de helps explain why the NP is preferably time-related, as it is easier for a time-denoting NP to establish an equational/appositional relation with the silent TIME. Dà 'big' is neither a size-denoting adjective, nor an evaluative morpheme. It is analyzed as an element like the restrictive adjective very (e.g., the very book) in English. Dà modifies the appositive conjunction phrase [NP de TIME], bringing emphasis to the construction, which in turn imposes certain semantic and pragmatic constraints on its subsequent clauses.摘要:本文主要探讨""大NP的""结构是如何通过组合的方式生成的。本文认为该结构中的""大""既非指涉尺寸大小的形容词，也非表示评价的语素，而是一个表示强调的限制形容词，其用法类似于英文the very book中的very。受Kayne(2016)的启发，我们假设该结构的""的""字之后有个没有语音实现形式的时间名词TIME。受Chao(1968)启发，我们认为该结构中的""的""是""的""的一种特殊用法，即""的""等同/同位用法，用来连接表示时间的NP和无声的TIME。""NP的TIME""是一个同位结构，受""大""修饰。由于""大""的强调作用(Lü 1999)，""大NP的""结构具有强调义，继而要求其后续子句在语义和语用上与之匹配，从而对后续子句产生一定的限制。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The nature of Old Chinese is mainly based on the historical comparison between Chinese and Tibetan Languages and Chinese loan words in other languages. For example, in Ancient Tibetan the stop codas were transcribed to voiced letters. The majority of bound function words in Classical Tibetan have two variants based on whether the preceding codas are voiced or not. The /-l(-r)/ coda in the ancient Chinese northern languages and early Sanskrit-Chinese phonetic transcription comes from the /-d/ coda. Old Chinese loan words in Japanese have voiced stop codas. Modern Chinese dialects also have voiced stop codas. In addition, stop codas in Tibetan Xigaze, Balti, Lajiao and other dialects, Xifan yiyu and Qiang languages all have the nature of releasing.

The core part of the Tangwang population came from Han people. Linguistic and genetic data suggest that a significant portion of the Tangwang populationsmight have come from Northern and Northwestern China. Loanwords from Arabic, Persian and Turkic wereintroduced via the Dongxiang (Santa) language and through preaching in Muslim mosques, but the proportion of these words is not significant. Loanwords from Dongxiang generally concern everyday life, while loanwords from Turkic, Persian and Arabic are related to religious items or rites.

It is found that both the subject-predicate and the prosody-syntax mismatched idioms elicited the P600 effect, whreas the coordinate idioms did not, and there is no significant difference in brain potentials between the subject-predicate and the prosody-syntax mismatched idioms. The results show that the cognitive processing of Chinese idioms is not a synthetic process of meaning extraction, but an analytic process based on the prosody-syntax interaction within the idioms. In addition, the processing of Chinese idioms is not affected by the syntactic relation between the constituents within the idiom. This study supports the view of prosodic syntax in Chinese that syntactic processing of Chinese idioms may be contrained by prosodic features.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

But so far, no one knows why such a discourse is possible. This paper makes an attempt to discuss this issue. It is argued that the possibility of homophonic discourse is principally attributed to the fact that unlike English, the Chinese language has a unique bipartite spelling system, i.e., one composed of Chinese character spellings and Chinese pinyin spellings, and that they correspond to each other in terms of over 400 Chinese Pinyin syllables with variations through tones which satisfy the phonological, graphological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic premises for the construal of a homophonic discourse.摘要:前美国语言协会主席赵元任教授曾经写了一篇题为《施氏食狮史》的同音文。但迄今为止，尚无人知道该类同音文何以可能。对此本文进行了探讨。认为同音文之所以可能，主要是因为汉语不像英语，它有一个独特的双重拼写系统，即一个由汉字拼写与汉语拼音拼写构成的系统，这两个拼写子系统通过超过400个音节加声调变化相对应，能满足同音文构建所需的语音、拼写、形态、句法、语义和语用等前提条件。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for Hanzi Braille to solve the above problems. Based on Mainland Chinese Braille (also called Current Chinese Braille), Hanzi Braille is customized by using the existing braille and adding signs in front of it. These signs, which are associated with radicals of Chinese characters, help distinguishing homophones and expressing the meaning of a Chinese character. Derived from the existing braille, Hanzi Braille breaks through the limitations of traditional braille. To some extent, it can help people with visual impairments integrate into the society of sighted people better and improve the efficiency of conversion between Chinese character and braille in the computer.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

This research investigates how and when the topic-shifter usage of 至於 was derived. I argue that it originated from Old Chinese 至, a verb of movement, plus 于/於, a spatial goal marker. This paper illustrates the step-by-step process of the lexicalization of 至于/於 by analyzing all occurrences of 至于/於 in the Academia Sinica Old Chinese texts database. Each stage of lexicalization is clearly distinguished using syntactic and semantic criteria: (a) the syntactic structure of the sentence in which [至于/於+Obj] appears, (b) the syntactic status of [至于/於+Obj], and(c) the semantic features of the object of 至于/於. 至于/於 was used as a topic-shifter as early as in the Warring States period. Its use as a topic-shifter started to increase significantly in Middle Chinese, as is reflected in Sanguo zhi 三國志. Finally, the lexicalization of 至於 into a topic-shifter was completed when 至於 was by far most frequently used as a topic-shifter and its original use became obsolete, as in Zhuzi yulei 朱子語類.摘要:\""至於（簡體'至于'）\""在現代漢語裏有轉換話題的功能。筆者 認為\""至於\""是由古代漢語表示移動的動詞\""至\""與表示到達點的 介詞\""于/於\""結合而成的。本文旨在通過考察從上古、中古到近代 漢語文獻所出現的關於\""至于/於\""的詞匯化演變用例闡述其最終轉 變為轉換話題功能的過程。本文的用例來自中央研究院漢籍電子文 獻中的古漢語語料庫 (http://hanji.sinica.edu.tw/) 。本文從語義和語 法層面上的差異觀察到\""至于/於\""的詞匯化階段。首先，在戰國時 期的上古文獻中開始出現極少數轉換話題的\""至于/於\""用例；到了 《三國誌》的中古時期，表示轉換話題功能的\""至于/於\""用例大幅 增加；最後，在近代漢語《朱子語類》文獻時期，大部分\""至於\"" 被用於轉換話題，原來的\""移動動詞+到達點\""用例微乎其微，而 \""至于\""的出現頻率大大縮減，其原因與\""于\""本身的消失有關。 到了現代漢語時期\""至於\""簡化為\""至于\""。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

We conclude that the time of diversification of /*tʃh/ and /*tʃ/ was no later than the 19th century. More precisely, it was between 1610 and 1844, and the sound change was conditioned by the short vowel -i- following the affricates. However, the ultimate formation of the four affricates in Khalkha is a result of the competition between the Rule of Diversification (Rule I) and the Rule of Fracture (Rule II), which operated in the same period and under the same condition.摘要:本文对汉字注音文献《华夷译语》《卢龙塞略》和 Dictionnaire Mongol-Russe-Français（蒙俄法词典）(Kowalewski 1844–1849) 中的标音进行了细致的梳理，研究了原始蒙古语词首塞擦音/*tʃh/和/*tʃ/在喀尔喀方言中分化的时间和条件。我们认为/*tʃh/和/*tʃ/在喀尔喀方言中分化的时间不晚于19世纪，即在1610–1844年之间完成；而分化的条件则与*tʃh-和*tʃ-后面紧跟的短元音-i-相关。喀尔喀方言中四个塞擦音的最终形成是\""分化规律\""（规律一）和\""转折规律\""（规律二）在同一时间内、同一条件下相互竞争的结果。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

OVERVIEW OF DIRECTIONAL PARTICLES IN CANTONESE: FORM, FUNCTION AND GRAMMATICALIZATION Traced back to verbs which denote direction and often referred to as directional complements in the literature, the twelve directional morphemes under investigation in Cantonese exhibit versatile usages. Despite that their number is small, the behaviors of this group of morphemes are heterogeneous. While most of them can be followed by a nominal which denotes location, hei2 起 ‘raise (something) up’ and hoi1 開 ‘move away’ cannot. Moreover, the grammaticalization paths that they have undergone are significantly different even for those of the antonymic pairs. While the directional meanings of all the morphemes have developed into abstract, non-directional and figurative meanings, only the meanings of some have evolved further to express the subjective evaluation of the speaker. The idiosyncrasies of this group of morphemes have attracted much attention from scholars. However, to this date, there is no systematic",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Given that Mandarin allows serial motion construction with multiple verbal morphemes, it is always an intriguing question as to how the morphemes are combined and ordered. To account for the allowed and disallowed sequences of prototypical motion verbs, three sequencing principles are proposed on par with the Proto-Motion Event Schema proposed in Liu et al. (2015). The proposed principles help to set the semantic boundary of a serial motion sequence (The Boundary-Setting Principle), rule out morphological combinations that are against the default order (the Non-Regressional Principle), and account for the prominence and characteristics of Path in motion predication (the Path-Delimiting Principle). As Path is an integral part of motion, it has to be properly delimited with a Path-delimiting element. These three principles may together account for the multi-morpheme motion sequences whose morphological structures are highly correlated with lexical semantic structures.

https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2017.0055,Xiangjun Deng,The Acquisition of Resultative Verb Compounds in Mandarin Chinese,2018," Resultative verb compounds (RVCs) in Mandarin appear in a V1-V2 sequence and have three major subtypes—result-state, directional and completive RVCs with different degrees of compositionality depending on the extent to which the compound’s meaning can be derived from the meanings of the component verbs. The derivation of the RVC has been analyzed as a lexical or syntactic process. Previous acquisition studies show that the RVC’s compositionality and event structure are not fully acquired before the age of three. Findings conflict on whether the acquisition process revealed by early RVCs is usage-based or rule-based. We examined longitudinal data from two Mandarin-speaking children and administered a novel verb experiment on 32 children. The lexicalist approach to RVC formation is a better account for our data than the syntactic approach. Our data lend support to rule-based learning of RVCs. Children master the event structure of RVCs and its interaction with aspect gradually. The headedness of the RVC in relation to event structure depends Acknowledgments This article was based on my MPhil thesis written under the supervision of Thomas Hun-tak Lee as a member of the Language Acquisition Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

R. Chao in the early 20th century (1933, 1968), the phenomenon he referred to as \""successive tonal addition\"" has been highly controversial. According to Chao, this intonation phenomenon expresses different moods and attitudes and manifests itself as rising and falling, non-lexical, pitch-movements added to the lexical contours of utterance-final syllables. Due to the lack of technological means at the time Chao could offer no instrumental evidence for his claims. Since 2004, numerous falling and rising pitch-phenomena reminiscent of Chao's \""successive tonal additions\"" have been observed by this author, who refers to \""utterance-final edge tones\"" (Ju wei jiayin句尾加音) (Mueller-Liu 2004, 2006, 2008).Expanding these earlier publications and containing new, hitherto unpublished data, this paper is a detailed account of the author's findings, including acoustic analyses of these pitch-phenomena and a conscientious description of their attitudinal messages and the discourse contexts in which they are found. The similarities and differences between falling and rising edge tones and Chao's falling and rising \""successive tonal additions\"" are also discussed in detail.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2019.0001,Che Wah Ho,Use of Alternative Characters in the Annotations of Ancient Texts,2018,"ABSTRACT:Exegesis (Xungu 訓詁) is an important branch of classical Chinese philology. It is a discipline devoted to the explanation of characters and expressions in ancient Chinese texts. The emergence of Xungu can be traced back to Er ya 爾雅, a Pre-Qin dictionary. The Han-Tang period, which is the heyday of the discipline, witnessed the production of many important Xungu works, most of them appearing in the form of commentaries. They have then become the indispensable guides to subsequent readers of classical Chinese texts. Given the canonical importance of these ancient commentaries, it is not surprising to see that most modern philologists regard the explanations of ancient Chinese texts offered in these classical Xungu works as authoritative dictionary meanings and uncritically adopt them in their own works. To date, however, little work has thoroughly examined how these ancient Xungu scholars arrived at their judgments. This article remedies this gap by clarifying the working mechanism of these ancient Xungu scholars in annotating ancient texts. It argues that these ancient Xungu scholars, when explaining a character in an ancient text, would first and foremost compare that text with parallel texts from other textual sources to identify textual variants. If a difference in terms of word choice existed between the text they were commenting and other relevant parallel texts, they would often uncritically use the latter to provide glosses to the former, even if the two were obviously not synonyms or near-synonyms. This article then shows that subsequent important philologists such as Zhu Junsheng 朱駿聲 (1788–1858) and Hong Yixuan 洪頤煊 (1765–1837), unaware of this unique working mechanism of ancient Xungu scholars, anachronistically mistook the judgments offered in these ancient Xungu works, which were simply made on the basis of textual variants, to be true and accurate dictionary meanings. As a result, they unavoidably established unnecessary connection between the semantically unrelated textual variants and ended up creating mistakes of their own.摘要:中國古代語言學之研究，重在訓詁。訓詁學乃中國傳統研究古書詞義 的專門學科，是中國傳統的語文學。訓詁之學，始於先秦的《爾雅》， 而大盛於漢晉的古籍注解。自漢代以來以迄於唐，古籍傳注蔚然成 風，其中重要典籍注家包括東漢《詩》毛《傳》，鄭玄《毛詩箋》，偽 孔安國的《尚書傳》，高誘《淮南子注》，三國六朝時王弼的《周易注》、 韋昭的《國語注》，王肅的《孔子家語注》，唐朝楊倞的《荀子注》等。 過去訓詁學家極重視古代典籍注解，視之為中國古代字義研究的重要 依據，鮮有懷疑這些古代學者的注解可有其他依據。本文嘗試援引書 證，以見漢晉以來諸家傳注訓詁，每有參考同書其他版本異文，甚或 互見文獻所見異文以為說解，例證甚多，自成系統。顯見據異文為注， 乃是中國學者注解典籍的一種傳統釋義方法。可惜過去語言學、訓詁 學者研習中國詞義詁訓時，於漢晉傳注相關訓解方式未有注意，未能 明晰此等訓詁其實源出重文異文，而重文異文又不必為同義甚或近義 詞。因之，此等字義訓詁既於古無徵，甚或扞格難通，後人不察，以 為相關字義解釋既出自漢晉著名學者，則其解讀自亦正確無誤，遂加 附會曲說，強為之解，舛誤乃生。本文提出諸如《說文》四大家的清 代學者朱駿聲、古籍義訓研究權威學者洪頤煊等，均因未明漢晉注家 上述訓釋詞義方法而產生誤解。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

We argue that the consonant, mainly the voiceless apico-alveolar plosives or affricates [t/ts/tʃ] as well as their aspirated counterparts tend to undergo trillization. On the other hand, at least three features [+high] [+rounded] [+fricative] for the vowels should be guaranteed. It is further argued that unlike the claim of Ladefoged and Everett (1996), “Tʙ” is not rare in the world’s language, but yields a high relevance to the friction of the high rounded vowel.

OVERVIEW OF DIVERSITY OF SINITIC LANGUAGES The difference in grammar, or morphosyntax, among Chinese dialects was once thought to be insignificant, as reflected in Chao’s (1968:13) famous claim that “[i]t is in matters of grammar that the greatest degree of uniformity is found among all the dialects of the Chinese language.” This idea, however, has been critically challenged since the 1980s when more dialectal data come into light. Diversity in Sinitic Languages is the latest milestone in the exploration of the grammatical diversity across Chinese dialects. As the book title suggests, the editor views traditional Chinese dialect groups as related but different languages. The term ‘Sinitic languages’ will be used throughout this review. The book under review comprises three parts, bringing together ten chapters by eight authors. All the chapters, except Chapter 3 by Peyraube, are products of the project entitled ‘The hybrid syntactic typology of Sinitic",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

From the same period when the primary edition of Jiu Manzhou Dang (Government archive of the early Manchu/Manzhou) [MG 1607–1636], we can see that the Manchus in the Northeast of China confused the two kinds of sounds at the beginning of learning Chinese language, which is described as the merge of jian and tuan sounds. After the entry of Manchus (1644), characterized by the merge of jian and tuan sounds, the imperfect Chinese language spoken by Manchus entered the inner city of Beijing and formed a contrast with the traditional Chinese language spoken by the Han people in the outer city of Beijing. Due to the implementation of the Manchu as the national language ( guoyu ) in the early Qing dynasty, the language spoken by Manchus in the inner city affected the language spoken by the Han people in the outer city through education. About 100 years later (1743–1810), in the spoken Chinese of the Han people in the outer city, the phenomenon of merging jian and tuan sounds appeared first only in some words, and then finally took over completely. This shows that the phenomenon of merging jian and tuan sounds in the Beijing dialect of the Qing dynasty is a result of the horizontal transmission of linguistic features from the Manchus in the inner city to the Han people in the outer city. The so-called ""horizontal transmission"" is the mutual effect between different languages when they contact with each other. The history of the Beijing dialect of the Qing dynasty is a history of the Manchus in the inner city abandoning the Manchu language, which was first converted imperfectly into the Chinese language and then finally merged with the spoken Chinese of the Han people in the outer city. In this process, on account of the special social status of the Manchus in the inner city, their spoken Chinese with the merge jian and tuan sounds affected that of the Han people in the outer city, and eventually prompted the same merge of two sounds of jian and tuan sounds among the latter, just as what had happened to the Manchus.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2018.0000,Haeree Park,Old Chinese in the Excavated Late Archaic Script: Problems of Working with Competing Ideas in Reconstruction,2018,"Excavated bamboo or wooden manuscripts dating from the 5th to 3rd centuries BCE have now become important new sources of data for Old Chinese phonology. The ways these sources are interpreted are necessarily based on methodological assumptions for Old Chinese reconstruction. So when debated issues in the latter are involved, disparate observations about the same materials turn out to manifest differences in the methodologies themselves. The study of Old Chinese through excavated manuscripts seems to become further complicated by considerations of the nature of the 'pre-Qin' archaic script and the provenances of the manuscripts. In response to these problems, as argued in this article, it is essential to recognize that the writings from the ancient Chu and Qin regions, notwithstanding the impressive range of graphic variability reaffirm the logographic nature of the Chinese writing system. The imperial 'script-unification' of the Qin dynasty was primarily an orthographic standardization in accordance with the norms of the old Qin region, whereby distinct regional variants were purged and preexisting internal variants were diminished. This by no means implicated such a drastic change in the writing system as a syllabary transforming to a logography. It is therefore necessary that the principles of OC reconstruction should be applied consistently to both the excavated archaic-script writings and transmitted early Chinese textual sources. It should be maintained first of all that the xiesheng (shared-phonophorics) and Shijing (the Book of Odes) rhymes in principle converge on a single phonological system, even though the actual history of the former is most probably older than the latter. This leads us to suppose about the OC vowel system that the Rounded Vowel Hypothesis does not hold, and that excavated texts have not yielded any data suggesting otherwise. Instead, this article suggests an alternative analysis of Middle Chinese (MC) - w - xiesheng series which had been received until that time; the regional variants thereof can complement each other as evidence for the Old Chinese phonology. When elements of dialects are found sporadically in the late archaic script, whether in Chu or Qin manuscripts, one may reasonably suspect that they reflect dialect-borrowings layered within the Old Chinese language.

1	The generalized copula function of wei derives from the “yi X wei Y” construction because of the disposal function of yi, and because wei absorbed the characteristics of the “yi X wei Y” construction This conclusion is based on two observations:
a	The unique features of wei as a copula are congruent with its function in the “yi X wei Y” construction
b	A change occurred from “V yi wei” to “V wei” indicating that wei replaced “yi wei” to a certain degree (see Table 5 below)
2	“X wei V” is an alternative of the “yi X wei V” pattern when a causer (C) does not appear with wei in the same clause This conclusion is further supported by the following three observations:
a	“Yi X wei V” and “X wei V” have the same (low) frequency
b	Both “yi X wei V” and “wei V” are very limited in their semantic range
c	The exchangeability of the “yi X wei V” and “wei V” constructions does not have any influence on their semantics 
Therefore, the “X wei V” structure should be regarded as a copula construction Although it would also be convenient to construe “X wei V” as a passive construction, it does not become so before the Han period because of the continued influence of the “yi X wei V” construction
“Wei A V” is formed through the omission of yi in the “yi X wei A V” or, alternatively, through the addition of the agent A in “wei V”, whereas “wei A (zhi) suo V” is the consequence of “A (zhi) suo V” replacing “A V” in “wei A V” Therefore, none of the wei constructions in pre-Qin should be regarded as syntactically functioning as passive constructions Rather, “wei A suo V” became a common passive construction only in the Han Dynasty

文章分析了“为”字功能的形成过程，并证明“为V”结构中的“为”应释为系词，而非被动标记。因此，“为V”结构本质上是系词结构而非被动结构。本文从分析“以X为Y”结构出发，得出以下结论：
 
一，“为”的系词功能来自于“以X为Y”结构，因为“以”的处置功能，及“为”吸收了“以X为Y”结构的构式特征。该结论基于两个事实：（1）“为”作为系词的功能特征和“以X为Y”的构式特征有高度的吻合性；（2）存在“V以为”省略为“V为”的明显发展趋势。 
二，当致使者不和“为”共现于同一个从句时，“X为V”是“以X为V”的可替换项。该结论基于三个事实：（1）二者的使用频率均较低；（2）二者中的“V”的语义范围均非常有限；（3）二者具有可互换性。虽然“X为V”具有成为被动式的潜力，但因无法摆脱“以X为Y”结构的影响而最终没有发展成为成熟的被动式。 
三，“为AV”可能是“以X为AV”省略“以”而成，或者由“为V”添加A而成，而“为A（之）所V”则是“A（之）所V”替代“为AV”中的“AV”而成。因此，先秦時期的“为”字式，从句法上来说都不是被动式。但是，“为A所V”在汉代成为了一个真正的被动式，而这个问题将在另一篇文章中细述。

More specifically, without contextual or acoustic cues, would native Mandarin speakers be biased towards disyllabic structures when listening to six-syllable utterances that can be parsed into syntactically similar structures composed entirely of disyllabic or trisyllabic feet? Results indicate that, Mandarin speakers tend to parse ambiguous utterances initially into one of the two possible syntactic structures rather than simply recognizing them as ambiguous. Nonetheless, they do not favour disyllabic structures when lexical information regarding word meaning, syntactic function, usage Acknowledgments The author would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their invaluable comments and suggestions, which have greatly enriched the arguments presented in this article.

My principal finding is that the perceptual adaptation, stress-to-tone mapping is constrained primarily by tonal feature model of native phonology, while acoustic similarity plays a very limited role. Besides, other factors, such as vowel length of the donor language, and Mandarin Grammar including tonal gaps derived from tonogenesis and even euphemism also account for the tonal assignment.

The previous research (Dong 2004, etc.) assumes that the development of the set underwent the process of lexicalization (Lehmann 2002): the syntactic strings [Y COP] lost their internal constituency and fused into one unit over time. This paper, however, in the light of Brinton and Traugott's (2005) criteria for distinguishing lexicalization and grammaticalization, and Traugott and Trousdale's (2013) hypothesis of constructionalization, argues that the copula shi coalescing with the preceding lexemes and changing into a bound morpheme underwent grammatical constructionalization rather than what Lehmann calls lexicalization. I argue that the process of change involves grammatical constructionalization, based on the analyses of generality/schematicity, productivity and compositionality.

Attempts to provide empirical evidence of the L2 English unergative-unaccusative distinction by adult Chinese speakers have only recently begun to appear. The present study investigates the acquisition of unergative and unaccusative verbs in L2 English by adult Chinese speakers. One hundred and twenty-one L1 Chinese speakers of different levels of English proficiency participated in a judgment test and a Chinese-English translation task. It is argued that the results are consistent with proposals made by Yip (1995) and Balcom (1997) which argue for overgeneralization of passive morphology to unaccusative verbs in L2 English. The results also show that, contrary to findings in the literature, learners have persistent difficulty establishing native-like syntactic realization of unergative verbs in L2 English: unergative verbs seem to have been interpreted as transitive verbs. It is speculated that the low accuracy on unergative verbs can be accounted for when Case assignment and the absence of positive evidence that unergative+NP construction is not allowed in English are factored in.Abstract:",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

However, 2+1 VO is acceptable when alternative length patterns are unavailable, such as jieyue shui 'save water' and xihuan qian 'love money'. The conditional acceptance of 2+1 VO is known as the 'last resort' effect. However, the predicted judgment difference has not been demonstrated experimentally. In addition, it is unclear whether native speakers find the last resort 2+1 to be as good as 2+2. Moreover, it is unclear what other factors may affect native judgment. To address the questions, we conducted a judgment experiment. Our study shows that (i) 2+2 VO is ranked the best, (ii) 2+1 is ranked the worst when a better form is available, and (iii) the last resort 2+1 is ranked between (i) and (ii). The result (iii) indicates a persistent effect of prosody, even for the last resort 2+1. In addition, we found a collocation effect between V and O.

SP and EGG signals were synchronously recorded from 72 young undergraduates or postgraduates (42 females and 30 males) while they were reading aloud a wordlist of 50 disyllabic words at their most comfortable pitch, loudness and rate. VAT measures revealed three findings. (1) Vocal attack time shows no significant difference between the common yangping and the yangping derived from shangsheng . This, from a physiological perspective, supports the argument that the tone sequence 3–3 in Mandarin is indeed converted into 2–3, nothing else. (2) The tones of Mandarin Chinese that start from low pitch levels (35, 21) tend to present significantly different VAT values from those that start from high pitch levels (55, 51), with mean VATs of the former being much longer than those of the latter. This embodies the nonlinear contra-variant relationship between VAT and F0 at vowel onsets.

Two social variables will be involved: age and gender. In the light of apparent time hypothesis, the findings help to determine whether such a variation is a result of an on-going sound change. The results reveal that there are two on-going tone changes in opposite directions, namely, 3a 2b and 2b 3a, and so far the former seems more forceful than the latter. The sound changes are carried out by lexical diffusion, and the unit of diffusion is more likely to be disyllabic and other polysyllabic compound words rather than monosyllabic morphemes. The gender variable, on the other hand, is found significant only in 2b 3a.

He argues instead that this word, while of Chinese origin, was borrowed through the mediation of Zhuang, and offers two competing hypotheses to explain the first syllable ma0-. First, he proposes that this ma0could be a Buyang prefix added after borrowing took place. Second, he suggests that Buyang ma l 0 ɔk11 'deer' was borrowed as a whole from Zhuang maxloeg 'deer', itself borrowed from Chinese 马鹿 mǎlù 'red deer'. In this paper, I evaluate Prof. Ho's claims from the point of view of Kra-Dai historical phonology. First, I show that his assertion that Buyang ma l 0 ɔk11 'deer' is a Zhuang loanword is due to a misunderstanding of the cited source. Second, I present evidence that at least some Buyang presyllables are archaic features that should be reconstructed back to proto-Kra-Dai.

https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2017.0016,Li Yanzhi; Wu Yicheng,On the evolutionary mechanism of disyllabic transitive verbs in Chinese,2017,"In Modern Chinese, there is an increasing number of disyllabic transitive verbs in the structural configuration [Vo] where o can be a nominal, a verbal or an adjectival morpheme, such as 观光 (guānguāng: lit.‘see sight’) ‘sightsee’, 投资 (tóuzī: lit. ‘throw money’) ‘invest’, 留心 (liúxīn: lit. ‘leave heart’) ‘be careful of’ and 注意 (zhùyì: lit. ‘focus attention’) ‘concentrate on’. These compound verbs can take another element as their objects and yield expressions in the structural configuration [Vo1+O2]. From an evolutionary perspective, this corpus-based study attempts to explicate the syntactic as well as the semantic mechanisms behind the formation and interpretation of disyllabic transitive verbs. It is pointed out that (i) the [VN+O2] type, which has the largest number, goes through three evolutional phases during which Noun Incorporation plays a crucial role; (ii) the [Vv+O2] type is a nested complex structure, in which v is the object of V and is mostly transitive and hence capable to take one more object; (iii) although the above mentioned two types of compound verbs have different evolutional processes and mechanisms, they both indicate that there is a possibility that verbs can be converted from intransitive to transitive. 提要: 现代汉语里有一类双音节动宾式（[Vo]）复合动词，其中的宾语成分 o 可以是名词性语素、动词性语素等，如“观光”、“投资”、“留心”、 “注意”。鉴于这类动宾式动词可带宾语的数量在现代汉语中呈现逐渐上升趋势，本文尝试对这种动词的演化机制和内因做出诠释。通过数据统计与分析，本文指出：（1）[VN]式动词带宾语经历了三个演化阶段，其中“名词吸收”起了关键作用；（2） [Vv]式动词带宾语是一种嵌套式动宾结构，第二个 v 是第一个 V 的宾语，本身又是及物动词，故[Vv]具有带宾语的可能性；（3）动宾式动词演化机制及过程并非完全相同，但都反映了及物动词与不及物动词相互转化的可能性。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The partial reduplication may operate rightward or leftward, depending on the morpho-semantic structure of the stem. The shape of the total reduplication is determined by the semantic function, emphatic or weakening. This paper employs the theory of Cophonology, and posits four cophonologies to account for the partial and total reduplications. I argue that alignment and contiguity constraints interact differently in the cophonologies of reduplication, and the cophonologies are structurally related.

Cham (review)",2017,"Mixed language use of Chinese and a foreign language is usually viewed negatively in mainland China and Taiwan. Perhaps the harshest critique of this linguistic habit is found in the well-received novel of Wei Cheng ‘Fortress Besieged’ by Qian Zhongshu, who compared the English words embedded in one’s Chinese speech to bits of meat stuck between one’s teeth. This mercilessly sarcastic criticism well demonstrates how insertion of English words in Chinese utterances is often stigmatized as showing off in either China or Taiwan. Hong Kong people, nonetheless, are blessed that they can be exempted from such judgment. Indeed, codemixing or translanguaging is not only commonly heard from TV channels, radio stations, or even on the streets, especially among college students, but the ability to switch between Chinese and English has been what is expected of the Hong Kong citizens, as exemplified by the Special Administrative Region’s language policy of biliteracy and trilingualism. This year celebrates the 20 anniversary of Hong Kong’s renationalization to China, so David C. S. Li’s newly published Multilingual Hong Kong: Languages, Literacies and Identities came as a timely and insightful overview of the linguistic and educational situation of this formerly British-ruled metropolis.

In fact, the editor himself echoed Alexander Pope in the quotation, “The sound must be an echo to the sense”. This special issue dedicated to the sounds and senses of Chinese poetry, the namesake fruit of an international conference in 2014, is therefore cogent beyond the usual demands of literary studies. As evident from the set of essays contained therein, the volume extends into a truly cross-disciplinary and multi-perspective research programme that promises to enrich not only our understanding of the literary works, but also the deeper cognitive aspects of our capacity for language, particularly phonology. I cannot help but wonder if Alexander Pope might be mistaken, because the sound in poetry is not an echo, it is the actual physical manifestation (acoustic-physics or articulatory-phonetics) of the senses encoded by the abstract symbols from the poets’ written hand. The volume is structured into three main parts, bookended by the editor’s introduction at the onset and his theoretical reflections in the coda. I find reading the introduction particularly rewarding.

It is shown that cognitive development plays a significant role in the development of spatial language. The acquisition of pang ‘side’ before you ‘right’ is accounted for by the cognitive complexity of the localizers. Cognitive egocentricity biased children under 4;0 towards the aligned strategy in interpreting qian ‘front’ and hou ‘back’, and caused 6-year-olds to rely on the viewer-centered frame of reference in interpreting zuo ‘left’ and you ‘right’ when the reference entity has inherent orientation.

The results show that far from agreeing on what constitutes a normal CS style, each of these groups has different normative perceptual contours, and distinct CS practices.

However, it has not yet been clear whether text spacing/segmentation facilitates the cognitive process in silent reading of Chinese, a logographic language, especially in reading Chinese regulated poems which have predefined rhythmic structures. An eye-tracking experiment was conducted to monitor eye movements of native participants in reading Chinese regulated poems in four segmenting conditions: normal text, character segmentation, rhythmic segmentation, and syntactic segmentation. By comparing a set of measures of eye movements, both global and local analyses showed that syntactic segmentation boosted reading efficiency, while rhythmic segmentation did not. The findings demonstrate that not rhythmic but syntactic structure plays major roles in the cognitive process in reading Chinese regulated poems, suggesting an intrinsic difference in the information structure between spoken and written languages. 提要: 以往的研究表明, 词间空格在字母文字的阅读过程中有重要作用。然 而, 这种间隔或切分对于语素文字如汉语的阅读、特别是对具有固定 节律的汉语格律诗的阅读, 是否有促进作用, 仍属未知。为此, 我们 采用眼球追踪技术, 考察了文本切分对汉语格律诗阅读的影响。实验 设计了四种文本切分模式: 正常文本、逐字切分、节律切分、句法切 分。通过全局分析和局部分析, 我们发现, 与句法结构相吻合的切分 能有效加快汉语格律诗的阅读, 而与节律结构相吻合的切分对汉语格 律诗的认知加工并无促进作用。研究结果表明, 是句法结构而不是节 律结构, 在汉语格律诗的阅读中发挥主要作用, 这也体现了书面语言 与口头言语在信息结构上的区别。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The rhyme table Shengyinchanghetu put the Ping tone character ‘dan’ with dental initial of Han rhyme at the ‘Fa’ line corresponding to the second division in the early traditional rhyme table Yunjing, together with the character ‘shan’ of Shan rhyme, but the Ping tone character ‘an’ with velar initial at the ‘Kai’ line corresponding to the first division, which shows that, in the Han rhyme, the rhyme with dental and sibilant initial is belonging to second division but the rhyme with velar initial is belonging to the first division. This is the headstream of acute-grave divergence of the Han rhyme in the historial documents. The so-called acute-grave divergence of the Han rhyme refers to the sound change in which the vowel of characters of the Han rhyme with acute initials diverges from the original vowel shared with their counterparts with grave initials, and merges with the vowel of the characters of the second division. This sound change is taking place in the 11th century northern dialects, and exhibits some regional variations in the paths taken. The transition is completed first for characters of Shang tone and Qu tone in the Bian-Luo dialect of the Northern Song Dynasty, as shown in the rhyme dictionary Jiyun, while first for characters of Ping tone in the You-Yan dialect of the Northern Song Dynasty, as documented in the rhyme table Shengyinchanghetu. In Mengguziyun and Zhongyuanyinyun, despite the fact that, irrespective of their initials, characters of Ping, Shang and Qu tones of the Han rhyme have the same vowel as characters of the second division, characters of Ru tone of the Han rhyme do exhibit patterns characteristic of the acute-grave divergence. This is clear evidence that the northern dialects of the Yuan Dynasty have undergone the acute-grave divergence. In the Yuan Dynasty, the vowels of characters with grave initials are further merged with that of characters of the second division. However, the loss of the ending *-t has excluded characters of Ru tone from the second wave of merging, resulting in the observed separation of Hanshan and Huanhuan. Therefore, the acute-grave divergence of the rhyme Han and the separation of the rhymes Hanshan and Huanhuan are two different phases of the single process in the history of northern dialects in which the low-back vowel *ɔ is replaced by low-front vowel *a before the endings *-t/*-n. The separation of Hanshan and Huanhuan rhymes has already emerged by the early 12 th century, as proved by a study of Hangzhou dialect developed after the migration of the Southern Song Dynasty, and data from Sino-Khitan transcription.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

OVERVIEW Zoulei, literally Red Gelao, is a language in the Gelao ( ) dialect cluster of Kra (Mandarin Geyang, ), which itself is a major branch of the Kra-Dai family (Ostapirat 2000). Zoulei is also known as Bigong, a toponym based on the name of the village in Guizhou Province where it is spoken. Like many Kra languages, Zoulei is severely endangered: only 368 people live in the village of Bigong, and in their book Li, Li, and Luo (2014) report that of those less than 30 individuals are fluent speakers of the language, all over the age of 60. Moreover, Kra is the least described branch of Kra-Dai, and this is the first full-length published grammar of any Kra language. With these considerations, the publication of A Grammar of Zoulei is an important contribution for Kra-Dai studies. This grammar was based on the dissertation of Xia Li under the supervision of Jifang Li at Minzu University. Professor Jifang Li had previously collaborated with the third author, Yongxian Luo, on The Buyang language of south China: grammatical notes, glossary, texts and translations in 2010 (Li and Luo 2010, see also Li and Luo 2006).

My purpose in entering this discussion is not to enlarge the compass of the speculations already advanced, but rather to rein them in with some reminders of things about which we have much better observational control. Following Norman and Mei (1976), Li maintains (2015, 224) that “There is linguistic evidence that the Austroasiatics inhabited the Yangtze delta and parts of the southeast coast [of China] during the first half of the first millennium B.C.” Regardless of how one regards the claim that modern forms of Min show traces of early borrowing from AA languages, these surely were not the only languages in southern China before political unification under Qin Shi Huang in the 3 century BC initiated the southward expansion of the Han Chinese. Hmong-Mien languages are indigenous to the lower Yangtze region, and Kra-Dai languages have been in southern China since the earliest Chinese records. We have no idea how many other language families were among the ‘Hundred Yue’, which have since become absorbed and lost to history, but given the present linguistic picture, and the known process of sinicization in recent centuries, we have every reason to believe that southern China was linguistically more diverse in 6,000 BC than it is today. It is, therefore, one thing to argue that possible loanswords in modern Min are evidence for a significant population of AA speakers in southern China before the",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The traces of such origins can also be found in the Chinese dialects which can be divided into three main categories. There exists a systematic correspondence between first person concept and proximal deixis concept, and between second person concept and distal deixis concept in Mandarin and southeast dialects. Therefore, the second personal pronoun er evolves into na , and the vacancy of the third personal pronoun can only be filled in with other pronouns which have nothing to do with proximal or distal demonstrative pronouns. Because of the mental distance of the referent of the third person concept and the historically later appearance of K series of distal demonstrative pronouns in the southeast dialects, the pronouns of the “other demonstrative” type ta and qi of specific reference similar in sound to the N series and the K series evolve into the third personal pronouns in the two categories of dialects. The concept of the third personal pronoun in northwest dialects corresponds to that of proximal deixis and distal deixis, and because its referent is mentally far, the distal demonstrative pronoun wu/na is used for the third personal pronoun as well. Such mechanism comes from Altaic languages. Probably similar is the evolution mechanism of the proximal demonstrative pronoun yi for the third personal pronoun.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1353/JCL.2016.0014,Wang Sunglan,On determining matrix language of code-switching between southern Min and Mandarin,2016,"This paper asks whether there is a universally applicable code-switching model. To answer this question, Myers-Scotton’s (2002) Matrix Language Frame model was tested with Southern Min/Mandarin code-switched data. The results showed that the two criteria (i.e. the morpheme order principle and the system morpheme principle) proposed to identify the matrix language in this model were found inapplicable. This is because Southern Min and Mandarin share most of their morphosyntactic structure and have a limited amount of inflectional morphology. To solve this theoretical problem, one supporting theory of the matrix language frame model (i.e. the uniform structure principle) and other possible criteria were also tested, but they were not successful. With the re-introduction of an additional criterion (i.e. the morpheme counting principle) to identify the matrix language, this study proposes a revised version of the matrix language frame model which was applied to re-analyze the Southern Min/Mandarin code-switched data. The results show that the matrix languages of 92.63% of the Southern Min/Mandarin bilingual clauses (340 in total) were unambiguously identified. This suggests that unlike the original model, the revised version of the matrix language frame model is able to cover a wider range of code-switched data (i.e. bothtypologically similar and different language pairs). With the empirical success of the original matrix language frame model reported in the previous literature and the success of additional principle proposed to particularly analyse code-switched data of a typologically similar language pair (Southern Min and Mandarin), this study argues that the revised version of the matrix language frame model is universally applicable. 提要: 本研究之目的在于寻找一个能适用于各种不同语言特性之语码转换 (code-switching)理论。为达此目的, 我们利用普通话及闽南话之语码 转换语料, 来测试 Myers-Scotton (2002)所提出的「主体语结构模式理 论 (The Matrix Language Frame Model)」。但测试结果发现, 该理论中 用来确认主体语的两项指标: 「词序原则 (the morpheme order principle)」及「系统词素原则 (the system morpheme principle)」皆无法 适用于普通话及闽南话的转换语料。由于此两种语言在句法结构上有 极高的相似性, 且在屈折型态学 (inflectional morphology)上的特性亦不 明显, 因而凸显出该理论无法处理句法、型态相似的语码转换语料的 缺陷。本研究尝试采用结构一致性原则 (the uniform structure principle) 及其他的替代方案, 但都无法有效确认普通话及闽南话转换语料的主 体语。因此, 我们在该理论的原有基础上稍做修正, 加入另一个确认 主体语的指标: 「词素计算原则 (the morpheme counting principle)」来 分析相同语料。分析结果显示: 在总数 340 个包含普通话及闽南话的 双语子句中, 有 92. 63%的子句之主体语能被清楚确认。由于现有的文 献指出, 原有的「主体语结构模式理论」已成功通过许多在句法、型 态上差异性大的语码转换语料的检测, 本研究所提出的修正版本更强 化了该理论, 使其亦能涵盖语言结构具高度相似性的语料。因此, 我 们认为本研究所提出「主体语结构模式理论」修正版本, 可适用于各 种不同语言所构成的语码转换语料。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

(2014) of its mitochondrial DNA, have brought new light on Austronesian origins. Liangdao man’s mtDNA belongs to a very early form of haplogroup E, which is exclusively Austronesian and well represented in Taiwan in two forms: E1 and E2. In JCL 43.1A (2015), Paul Li discusses the “implications for the pre-Austronesian homeland” of the discovery of Liangdao man. Li’s assumptions are these: on the ground of morphological arguments in Reid (1994), he accepts the view that Austronesian and Austroasiatic are sister branches of ‘Austric’. A critique of these morphological arguments can be found in Kaufman (2013). Li also accepts the arguments of Norman and Mei (1976) for an Austroasiatic presence on the southeast China coast. See however Sagart (2008) for a critique of their lexical arguments. Based on these assumptions Li supposes that unitary Austric was spoken on the southeast China coast and that Liangdao man spoke Austric (‘an Austric’, p. 228). Li correctly reports the finding by Ko et al. that Liangdao Man’s mtDNA is the ancestral form of all Formosan E1 haplotypes. He is silent, however, on the origin of Haplogroup E: according to Ko et al., haplogroup E developed out of haplogroup M9 on the southeast China coast near Fuzhou 福州 c. 8,136–10,933 years ago. As to haplogroup M9 itself, it gave rise to another daughter on the mainland: M9a, which is found among Chinese, Tibetan and other Sino-Tibetan-speaking groups.

In contrast to the more uniform form in Southern Min, varieties of Hakka boast more variants such as mak 7 , maʔ 7 and man 3 . Such a variation can be accounted for in terms of minor regional difference as well as types of phonological process. The retention of the bilabial nasal initial of the word 物 as a reflex of the Middle Chinese 微 phonological category in Hakka lends support to the thesis of lexical diffusion that sound change is not phonologically independent but rather bears the result of interaction with lexicon. Second, on the basis of earlier Hakka texts I will examine the patterns in the distribution of the modern reflex of 物 often written as a demotic word 乜 in its capacity of a variable as a component of the complex interrogative words ‘what’, ‘who’ (=what person) and ‘why’ (=do what kind) or universal quantifiers in Hakka. The finding of the patterns of the Hakka interrogative word will be brought to bear on the patterns of its precursor in Early Modern Chinese colloquial texts. Close attention will be paid to the interaction of inherent lexical properties of the interrogative word and the grammatical constructions in which it occurs. Last of all, an attempt is made to survey the distribution and evolution of the Hakka-related 物-based interrogative word in other dialectal areas.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

This paper first provides a comprehensive description of the sound changes in the Dongfeng dialect, and has identified nine major differences between the Dongfeng dialect and the surrounding local dialect in syllable initials, finals and tones. Drawing on the theory of lexical diffusion, it then explores the pattern of spreading of sound changes from the perspectives of word frequency, competing changes and residues. As a tentative conclusion, it is posited that the sound changes in Dongfeng village over a span of 40 years are the results of the competition of the dual influence from the local dialect and Mandarin. Lexical diffusion of the various types of sound changes is not only related to word frequency, but is also sensitive to word class. The word frequency effects are significant only within word classes.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Mandarin tones have been previously reported to be sufficiently identified by F0 contour, while phonation cues are redundant. This study provides evidence to show that native Mandarin speakers are sensitive to phonation cues in identifying the four mandarin tones in isolated syllables. Moreover, Mandarin Tone 3 more strongly relies on phonation cues in its identification than the other three tones, which probably derives from the usual accompanying non-modal voice (creaky voice) in Tone 3 production. These results thus indicate the need to define language tones in a finer model that incorporates detailed phonation parameters.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

This could be shown in a sober statistical manner, of course, by looking at textual occurrences of distinct syllables in a good OC reconstruction. Over the years, however, I have come to prefer to demonstrate that point in classes and lectures in a more intuitive way (Behr 2009), by using Y.R.

Programs for breathing analysis have been written to extract parameters, such as breathing reset amplitude, time of inhalation phase, and slope of exhalation phase. The results show that the poem chanting has a larger depth of breathing and amount of breath, and more frequent exhalations compared with the poem reciting. In both poem reciting and chanting, the pause and declination of chest breathing is closely correlated with the prosodic boundaries. The major function of chest breathing in speaking is to keep the chest extended and provide enough breath for articulation and chest resonance.

Signals of speech, airflow, and air-pressure from 20 speakers (10 males and 10 females) were collected by using Phonatory Aerodynamic System (PAS6600). Parameters, including duration, sound pressure, air-pressure peak, airflow peak, airflow volume were measured. The results showed that: 1) The aerodynamic features of initials vary among different speakers, which might be attributed to their gender or articulation habits. Male speakers have higher air-pressure, airflow peak and expiratory volume (EV) than females, which might be attributed to a greater lung capacity of the male. 2) Aspirated consonants have higher sound pressure level (SPL), expiratory airflow duration (EAD), peak air-pressure (PAP), peak expiratory airflow (PEA) and EV than their unaspirated counterparts. Therefore all these parameters can be regarded as criteria for distinguishing aspirated and unaspirated consonants. 3) The vibration of vocal cords in voiced consonants has an immediate impact on SPL, which leads to higher SPL values than those in voiceless consonants, but air-pressure is just the opposite. The PEA and EV of voiced consonants are close to those of voiceless stops, but these two parameters are far smaller than those for other consonants. 4) The aerodynamics of consonants with different articulatory manners are significantly different, thus the EAD, PAP, PEA and EV parameters can all be regarded as the distinctive features of consonants.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

A study of online love-advice narratives reveals that, in the case of new items, fuller NP forms in Vernacular Written Cantonese are more frequently used for more topical, referential, and plural entities. For given items, however, contrary to the predictions of accessibility theory, topical entities and those with a previous reference using a longer NP form are associated with fuller, rather than more abbreviated, NP forms.

The most recent genetic study indicates that the Liangdao man seems to be more closely related to modern Formosan natives than to the other peoples in South China and Southeast Asia. Ancient South China was almost exclusively populated by non-Chinese. There is linguistic evidence that the Austroasiatics inhabited the Yangtze delta and parts of the southeast coast during the first half of the first millennium B.C. Some of the Austroasiatic loanwords currently in Chinese in general and in Min are part of the basic vocabulary. This indicates the Chinese and Austroasiatics must have been in close contact for a long period of time before the first millennium B.C. The linguistic evidence for the genetic relationship between Austronesian and Austroasiatics is not very strong, but nevertheless exists.

Chinese VV Compounds’ identical morpho-syntactic structure represents different event relations between the two component words and the correct interpretation of the meaning of these compounds relies on the prediction on their event relations. Without overt syntactic clues, we propose that ontology-based conceptual classification can be used to predict the event relation between the two component words. Compounding is the most productive way to research multi-word expressions in Mandarin Chinese. A Mandarin VV compound can be classified according to the eventive relation between two simplex verbs, which specifies how the eventive meanings of the two simplex verbs combine to form the meaning of the compound. The way in which two events combine with each other depends upon their event types, and the three types of eventive relations that we deal with in this paper are coordinate, modificational, and resultative. Using an ontology-based prediction approach, we hypothesized that the eventive relations could be predicted by the conceptual classification of the two simplex verbs’ event types. First, we utilized SUMO and Sinica BOW to classify each simplex verb. Next, the correlation between the ontology-based classification of each verb position and each eventive type was scored using a manually tagged lexical database and a training set was established. Finally, we encoded the ontological information of each VV compound in a 3-tuple based on these correlation scores. This 3-tuple was represented as a three-dimensional vector and was used to predict the eventive type of the new VV compounds. The results of our findings show that the classification experiments on event relation of unknown VV compounds can be reliably predicted based on the ontological classification of their component words.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

This paper has explored the articulatory mechanism of speech production in Standard Chinese and developed a geometric articulatory model in both the visual and acoustic modalities. This model was based on the data of MRI images and X-ray movie, with the former providing detailed volumetric information of the vocal tract, and the latter the dynamic information of articulation. In this model, the seven articulators have been studied and modeled, including the hard palate, pharynx, jaw, lips, velum, tongue, and larynx. The tongue is modeled as two parts: tongue tip and tongue body, thus reducing the necessary number of parameters. The relation between larynx height and fundamental frequency in regard to the four tones is also modeled. These two improvements on tongue and larynx modeling have contributed new ideas to the articulatory modeling of Standard Chinese. This model can serve as a research tool for linguists, phoneticians, and speech engineers, and can be used in parameter speech synthesis, virtual speaker, and visual assistant speech training of Standard Chinese. 提要: 爲了更好地理解言語的產生過程,即如何從音位輸入到調音器官的動 作、再到聲學輸出,需要建立詳盡的聲道調音模型。本文是對漢語普 通話言語產生中調音機制的探索與研究,建立了一個具有視覺和聲學 輸出的幾何調音模型。該調音模型的數據源自於聲道的磁共振圖像和 X 光錄影,前者主要提供聲道的立體形狀,後者提供調音的動態過程。 在這個模型中,聲道被分解為七個調音部位進行研究:硬齶、喉腔後 壁、下頜、雙唇、軟齶、舌頭和喉管。其中創新性地,舌頭又被分為 舌體(相對簡單)和舌尖(更為靈活)兩部份,從而簡化所需要的參 數;另外,普通話四聲中基頻高低與喉管上下高度的關係也加入到模 型中。該模型可以作為研究工具服務於語言學、語音學和言語工程, 並可用於語音參數合成、虛擬說話人、普通話輔助教學等領域。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

These goals are achieved by using a tonal model called the Multi-Register and Four-Level Model, which represents tones along four parameters: register, length, height, and contour. Having excluded a quasi-falling tone, this paper identifies seven Falling Tonotypes in the M Register: High, Low, MS-High, MS-Low, Deferred-High, Deferred-Low, and Slight Falling. Four of these also occur in the L Register with special voice qualities. In total, there are eleven Falling Tonotypes, which can be specified according to five distinctive features.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Results strongly supported an ongoing process of devoicing for the voiced stops, fricatives and affricates, which is conditioned by a couple of factors including sex of speaker, place of articulation, manner of articulation and historically tonal type. Specifically, historically voiced obstruents in syllables corresponding to the historical tone category Ru have all become voiceless unaspirated or voiceless aspirated, meaning the process of devoicing has already completed; in contrast, for those that occur in syllables corresponding to the other three tonal categories, i.e., Ping, Shang , and Qu , i) the historical devoicing is still in progress, as evidenced by a considerable amount of intra- and inter-speaker free variation in the pattern of voicing among “fully voiced”, “partially devoiced” and “fully devoiced” obstruents; ii) the degree of devoicing is the highest in voiced fricatives, followed by the voiced affricates, and is the lowest in voiced stops; and iii) the devoicing also tends to be more extensive for obstruents with a more posterior place of articulation, and for male than female speakers. Candidate explanations for these patterns of devoicing were also presented.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Most of the previous studies focus on the comparison between the Southern Wu (SW) and Min and neglect the materials of Northern Wu (NW). Through comparative studies, strata analyses and referring to Chinese historical phonology, we assume that some phonological traits in NW, SW and Min all come from Qieyun or the Jiangdong dialect in the Southern dynasty. This paper also points out that although Wu dialects in southern Zhejiāng are more similar to Min than Northern Wu, such places in NW as Dānyang, Changshu and “Chongqĭhǎi” near Jinling geographically regarded as the center of the Jiangdong dialect, probably retain some early phonological traits in the Southern dynasties, which is also similar to modern SW and Min.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

In order to simulate the behavior of the articulatory apparatus, computational modeling is a commonly-used method. We have constructed a full 3D physiological articulatory model that includes the tongue, jaw, hyoid bone and vocal-tract wall based on the continuum finite element method. This model comprises articulatory muscles with realistic properties and geometrical arrangements. The muscle activation patterns are used to control the movements of the model. In order to use the model to investigate the speech motor control mechanism, generate speech sounds, predict the effect of surgical operation, etc., we have to realize an automatic control strategy. The task of the control strategy is given a particular target, how to generate muscle activation patterns that can control the model to achieve the target. There are two main control strategies for the physiological articulatory model: feedforward control and feedback control. Feedforward control is a kind of mapping used to directly find muscle activation patterns according to the desired target, and feedback control is used to adjust muscle activation patterns to reduce the distance between the desired target and the realized position. In speech production, feedforward mapping is used to rapidly generate muscle activation patterns to control the articulators to produce fluent speech. Feedback control plays the role of learning and maintaining the feedforward mapping. When the degree of accuracy using feedforward mapping cannot satisfy the requirement, feedback control can be used to realize fine motor control. In this paper, we describe how to use feedback control as a learning loop to construct feedforward mapping. The constructed feedforward mapping was assessed through an open-set test, and reasonable articulatory positions were obtained by comparison with the desired targets. Furthermore, the ability of feedback control to improve control accuracy was proved by a large quantity of simulations. 提要: 在言語產生的過程中,發音器官是執行來自中樞神經系統的運動指令的 終端組織。電腦建模的方法常常被應用於模擬發音器官的行為。為此, 我們使用連續體有限元的方法建立了一個三維的發音器官的生理模型, 該模型包含舌、下頜、舌骨以及聲道壁等發音器官。該模型還包括了根 據其生理解剖屬性建立的用於控制發音器官運動的肌肉模型。為了將該 生理模型應用於探索發音器官的運動控制機制,產生自然流暢的語音, 對發音器官的手術後功能進行預測等,我們需要對模型建立一個自動的 控制機制。控制機制的任務在於給定一個發音目標,如何自動的產生肌 肉激活模式去控制模型到達目標。對於發音器官的生理模型而言,有兩 種主要的控制方式:前饋控制和回饋控制。前饋控制是一種從發音控制 目標到肌肉激活模式的映射,用於根據發音目標產生肌肉激活模式;而 回饋控制主要用於調整肌肉激活模式來減少模型實現的位置到目標之間 的距離,最終控制模型到達目標。在言語產生的過程中,前饋控制用於 快速的產生肌肉激活模式控制發音器官產生流暢的語音。回饋控制主要 用於學習前饋控制的映射,並且維持前饋控制可行性。當前饋控制的精 度不能滿足需求時,回饋控制可以用於提高控制精度以實現精確控制。 在本文中,我們將重點介紹如何使用回饋控制作為學習回路,建立前饋 控制的映射。對已建立的前饋映射的開集測試表明該映射可以用於控制 模型在誤差允許範圍內達到目標。而且,大量的模型模擬表明回饋控制 可用於改善前饋控制的控制精度。",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Therefore, the morpheme is the basic grammatical unit. In other words, morphemes and words are not distinguishable in early Chinese. In modern Chinese, however, combinations of morphemes may be generative or non-generative. Morphemes in non-generative combinations are not basic units but rather constituents of basic units. From an evolutionary perspective, the basic units of the Chinese language developed from a single tier (morpheme/word) to a double tier (morpheme and word) constitution (Wang 2015). Interestingly, some researchers have correlated monosyllabic to multisyllabic 1 change, phonological simplification, and language contact. Scholars like Wang (1958) hypothesized that the latter two cause the syllabic change. Conversely, Zhang (1939) argued that the simplification of phonology does not cause an increase of homophones if the vocabulary is limited. He suggested that the great lexical expansion during the Western Zhou dynasty and the Spring and Autumn period activated multisyllabication. Additionally, Lu (1963) supported this theory based on twentieth-century observations of a significant increase of disyllabic words that were void of preceding phonological changes.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Two speech sounds, namely, the voiceless unaspirated alveolar stop /t/ and the high front vowel /i/, were studied to examine the domain-initial strengthening in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The articulatory and acoustic parameters of the speech sounds were compared in initial positions of five prosodic constituents in Standard Chinese, namely, a Syllable, a Foot, an Immediate Phrase, an Intonational Phrase, and an Utterance. The results show that: (1) the production of the domain-initial consonantal gesture was prosodically encoded. The linguopalatal contact and the seal duration varied as a function of the prosodic boundary strength. The linguopalatal contact was dependent on the seal duration in a nonlinear fashion. Of the acoustic properties of the domain-initial stop, the total voiceless interval and voicing during closure were found to be reliable acoustic correlates that mark the hierarchical structure of the prosody. (2) At the release moment of the domain-initial stop, no consistent pattern was found to support the domain-initial strengthening. The linguopalatal contact of the vowel immediately following the domain-initial consonant did not show a clear trend of domain-initial strengthening; however, the phonatory features of vowels were indicative of pitch reset at major prosodic boundaries. These indicate that the domain-initial strengthening is restricted on the segment immediately following the boundary. In conclusion Standard Chinese strengthens the phonetic features of the domain-initial segments as a function of boundary strength, which serves as an important way to mark prosodic structure in Standard Chinese.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Principles of first language acquisition have widely been attested to operate in second language and/or foreign language acquisition. However, not much attention has been paid to the comparison between first language acquisition and lexical borrowing, although lexical borrowing also clearly involves similar processes and/or principles of foreign language acquisition in various forms. Specifically, we will show that fricatives of source language are changed to stops in target language, in parallel with the well-known phonological process that fricatives are realized as stops and that they are acquired later than stops in first language acquisition. Supporting evidence is provided from the comparison between general language acquisition data and strengthening of fricatives found in the lexical borrowing from Chinese by Vietnamese. In so doing, we will compare the alveolar fricatives in Chinese and their borrowed forms in Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Korean.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

In this paper acoustic features are investigated for modal and creaky voices in Dilu. In particular, the parameters of Open Quotient (OQ) and Speed Quotient (SQ) are examined. We discuss whether it is necessary and possible for female and male modal voices to collapse into one category to serve the purpose of phonological transcription.

I gave reasons to believe that it could hardly have happened that way, but Wang Feng offers some fascinating statistical material which is quite new to me. (I am ashamed to say that I know little of the research literature being published within China.) According to Wang Feng, the sound-changes which have made Mandarin phonological structure so much simpler than that of Old Chinese were concentrated within two periods of just a few centuries each; and his Figure 1 shows that the propensity of Chinese to use compound words, though it has risen more or less continuously since the earliest written documents, rose particularly fast also over two short periods. These data, Wang Feng says, make it likely “that an increase of multisyllabic words in Chinese preceded phonological simplification”. That conclusion could follow only indirectly, I presume.

Due to the relatively shorter histories of contact languages as compared to ‘normal’ languages, semantic changes in contact languages are far better understood, thereby presenting us with case studies of polysemous words where contact-induced change and regular semantic change can be better demarcated. Studying such phenomena will thus shed light on the cognitive processes behind semantic change. This paper looks at how language use shapes the semantic pathway of Singapore Southern Min loanword balu and suggests that the findings in this paper can be applied cross-linguistically to other cases of regular semantic change. Singapore Colloquial Malay adverb baru ‘recently’ was borrowed into Singapore Southern Min as balu ‘recently’. Although Southern Min balu and Malay baru both share a common function, they exhibit disparate semantic pathways. Data gathered shows that loanword balu ‘recently’ has no tendency to develop a conjunctive function similar to that of Singapore Colloquial Malay and baru ‘recently’ has no tendency to develop another adverbial function like that of balu ‘recently’ in Singapore Southern Min. Initial findings of this paper suggest that the contrasting semantic pathways for Southern Min balu ‘recently’ and Malay baru ‘recently’ are due to differences in semantic fields a particular word is most strongly associated. Nevertheless, the overarching mechanism behind both semantic changes is still pragmatic inferencing, or in other words, a reanalysis of contextually ambiguous sentences.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

In this paper, based on EGG signals, three parameters, namely F0, Open Quotient (OQ) and Speed Quotient (SQ), are extracted to examine the tonal quality. It is found that there are two non-modal phonation types, Harsh and Pressed, and roughly four groups of pitch pattern (31/31/41; 33/433; 55/54; 35) in the eight tonal categories. One pair of tones can only be distinguished from each other by phonation type since their pitches are the same. As for other pairs, both pitch and phonation type may contribute to the distinction between them. Notably, non-modal phonation types vary across different Bai speakers. For a particular non-modal tone, one speaker may employ harsh voice, while another may use pressed voice. Sometimes, the non-modal phonation type even changed within a syllable. It is then suggested that different strategies may be used to produce non-modal tones in contrast with their modal counterpart. Moreover, based on the Bai data, how to define different phonation types based on the three basic parameters, F0, OQ and SQ, is discussed. Harsh voice is a better term for the type with the laryngeal features [Middle falling F0, -OQ, -SQ] rather than high-pitched voice.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Thus when singing songs from a tonal language such as Mandarin, it is likely that there will be conflicts between articulation of the linguistic tone and the articulation of the musical melody. Envisage for example, a syllable that is linguistically specified for a rising tonal contour being associated to a melody requiring a falling contour or a flat contour. In such a situation, satisfaction of the melody would result in incomprehensibility of language. The reverse is equally devastating since then song would be totally superfluous. Nonetheless, a survey of Mandarin songs indicates that linguistic tones are often not faithfully preserved in tune, consequently giving rise to the question on how listeners are able to decipher the words that are sung. This paper argues that the crux of the matter lies in the identification of two elements, headship in music and headship in linguistic tones. A head, in music or language, is a special position where the features of the residing element are prominent. In essence, it is the preservation of contrasts between prominent features at these special positions that listeners of Mandarin songs are able to reconstruct the lyrics from partial segmental and tonal information.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The construction [ GA � + NP] renders specific interpretations that cannot be directly derived from the lexical meaning of either the verb or the object NP. The construction itself carries salient information for the appropriate interpretation. The ‘ellipsed’ eventive information is analyzed from the perspective of Construction Grammar (Goldberg 1995). Moreover, a compositional framework based on Qualia ��(Pustejovsky 1995) is utilized to resolve the potential ambiguity arising from the construction-triggered meaning. By combining the two complementary approaches, this paper attempts to account for and represent contextualized information as well as varied meaning facets associated with a partially-filled construction.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

One conversation and two types of oral narratives are taken as distinct types of speaking for purposes of examining the potential text-type difference against information status. The unique and recurrent patterning of information status across conversation and narrative discourse suggests a pragmatic motivation for word order. The preverbal roles, be it A, S or O, have a great propensity for given information; the postverbal roles, either S or O, maintain a much higher incidence of new information. This lack of accusative or ergative alignment of argument roles has a parallel in grammar where the major syntactic processes treat A, S and O in the same way, suggesting an iconicity between discourse and grammar in Mandarin Chinese.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

,Jingtao Sun,Retrogressive reduplication in old chinese,2003,本文旨在對古漢語中的逆向重疊作出描寫。調查表明，古漢語中的此類重疊主要適用於動詞。當一個單音節動詞重複為兩個音節之後，“動作重複”這樣的語義特征便隨即產生。此類重疊亦適用於名詞，不過就其產生途徑而言，其基式原本也是動詞。從語音形式來看，一個單音節動詞的重疊會帶來如下變化：如果基式的韻母（包括所謂介音）對區別特徵﹝圓唇﹞呈正值，那麼，基式前面的重疊部分便會在其相應的位置上呈負值；如果基式的韻母對區別特徵﹝圓唇﹞呈負值，我們所能看到的卻並非所期待的﹝＋圓唇﹞／﹝－圓唇﹞的對立，實際所看到的是一種“無標記／有標記”的對立。此一類型的重疊實乃語音與語義語法交互作用的結果。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics

,Dan Xu,The Status of Marker gei in Mandarin Chinese,1994,"In contemporary Chinese the morpheme gei, which is a full verb meaning ‘to give’, may be used either as an agent marker or as an object marker. In fact, the verbs meaning ‘to give’ often turn into agent markers in other Chinese dialects, and even in other languages. I have studied the status of gei in Mandarin Chinese in two cases, gei as an agent marker or as an object marker:
（1）羊给狼吃了。yang gěi lang chī le sheep -GEI-wolf-eat-final particle, ‘The sheep has been eaten by the wolf.’（gei =agent marker）
（2）狼给羊吃了。lang gěi yang chī le wolf-GEI-sheep-eat-final particle, ‘The wolf has eaten the sheep’（gei＝object marker） 
This phenomenon in spoken Beijing Mandarin has been compared to its appearance in other dialects. The verb ‘to give’>causative marker>passive marker change is attested in 23 dialects, while the verb ‘to give’/ ‘to take’>active marker is found in 22 dialects in China. The verb meaning ‘to give’ used as an agent marker is a generalizable phenomenon; the key step that gei can mark the passive is the connection between its original verb meaning (‘to give’) and its causative function. Causative verbs actually constitute one of the common sources of passive markers in Chinese. This phenomenon is attested in both Southern dialects and in non-Han languages. As to why gei in Mandarin Chinese can be both an agent marker and an object marker, semantic and lexical reasons were presented to show that these kinds of verbs are susceptible to development in a contrary direction (‘to give’ or ‘to receive’) as ‘to take’ in English (Take him another book, take=give. He took my book, take=take away) or louer ‘to rent out to/to rent from’ in French. The affix ‘do-’ means ‘to give’ in French while ‘da-’ in Hittite (Benveniste, 1966) indicates ‘to take away’.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Dwyer,Altaic Elements in the Linxia Dialect: Contact-Induced Change on the Yellow River Plateau.,1992,"Language contact between the Han and non-Han languages of China has often been assumed to be unidirectional (i.e., Han > non-Han) and limited generally to lexical items, while morphosyntactic interference is believed to be moderate and comparatively recent. However, in the northwestern Chinese dialect of Linxia, it will be shown below that in fact the opposite is true: the Linxia dialect consistently retains certain native phonological and lexical features, while undergoing heavy interference in syntax. In this paper three examples illustrating the nature and extent of contact- induced change in the Linxia dialect are examined. In Section 1 the morphemes for ‘small, little’ of the region’s languages are compared as an illustration of extensive lexicosemantic diffusion resulting in areal convergence. In Section 2 it is concluded that the co-existing markers of the comitative/ instrumental in Linxia represent two different types of borrowing: one, a calque on a compound numeral of the Mongolic languages of the region, and the other an outright loan from Mongolic of the Proto-Altaic comitative suffix *-lū. Finally, as an example of significant syntactic and phonological reanalysis, in Section 3 the Linxia postpositional conditional marker -Ȓȕ is examined. We conclude that this is the result of the combination of certain social and linguistic factors, and that social factors, such as political dominance, may well be the primary determinants of change 2 . These data provide evidence to support a reanalysis of certain universals of language contact.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

,Chaofen Sun,The adposition yi and word order in classical chinese,1991,語言學家對古漢語中介詞短語的句法特點有不同的看法。有的認為古漢語中的介詞短語大都是在動詞的後面，但也有人持反對意見。本人支持後者的觀點。事實上古漢語中的介詞短語用在動詞前後均可。在應用上，動詞前和動詞後介詞短語的使用頻率似乎是不相上下。在古文中，“以”字有時用在動詞前，有時用在動詞後，在動詞前的，有時還是後置詞。有不少例子顯示“以”字的用法可能是有一定規律的。動詞前的和動詞後的“以”字句可能是和上下文的話語結構有關。動詞前“以”字後的名詞一般都較動詞後“以”字後的名詞較接近它的先行詞“antecedent＂。至於“以”字後置詞的用法則可能是因上古語法的演變而造成的。漢語的詞序可能是從漢藏語的主賓謂演變成主謂賓。所以，古漢語中的後置詞用法可能是古漢藏語語法的痕跡。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics

,Ren Xiaobo,The post-verbal constituent in chinese passive forms,1991,現代漢語中的被動式一般是需要有一個補語跟在動詞後面。這似乎已經成為一個必要的條件。而古漢語的被動式卻不需要這個成份呢。本文從三個方面來解釋這句法現象。首先是V-R式的迅速發展。古漢語表達使動式只要用V-O就可以了，而現代漢語必須用V-R式。由於被動式不僅表達被動行為，更重要的是還表達被動行為所造成的結果。因此在V-R式的影響下，R是不可缺部分。其次是被動式動詞的語態。被動式一般表達完成態。完成態動詞一般後面跟一個完成態的標記。如果遇到未完成態動詞，必需在這個動詞後面加上某個補語成份，也就是說加上完成態的意義。因此，無論是完成態動詞還是未完成態動詞，補語成份都是不可缺的。最後是V-R式的講義分析。從語義角度看，V起方式方法狀語的作用，而R反而是句義中心所在。因此R是不可缺少的。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics

Cheng,Chinese Question Words and Their Meanings.,1984,汉语的疑问形式，有的是单词（疑问词：谁，什么，那儿，为什么，多少。句尾问词：吗，呢，吧）有的是词组结构（正反问，也即A或非A结构：他是不是男的？选择问也即A或B结构：他是男的或是女的？）形式虽异却又一个共同的意义：（就是指待人选择的一些特定的可能性），和一些特殊意义：1.说话者要求听话者选择（如，谁来了？）。2.由更高子句的主语进行选择（如，他猜中谁来了）。3.暂时不管选择（没有谁来）。4.全盤选取（谁都来了）。5.條件选择（谁先到谁就先買票）。6.列举末尾的不定语（我见了老李，老张，谁的）。一般说来上下文决定某疑问形式的特殊意义。本文特别探讨前三种特殊意义如何决定的问题。又下面A句，B句和C句结构虽同，句义却不同：A.你猜中了谁在里头（由主语“你”进行选择）。B.你想谁在里头？（说话者要求听话者选择）。C.你看见谁在里头（？）（有歧义）。我们可以将疑问形式用做宾语的动词分为三类：一，参加选择的。二，不参加选择的。三，可参加也可不参加选择的。以便分析这种结构的句子如何表达各种不同的特殊意义。这三种动词的分类和各动词的意义有关。本文在结论里又指出疑问形式具有相似的几种不同的特殊意义的，除了普通话以外，还有其他汉语方言，以及日语、韩语。可见这些特殊意义之间，有特定的逻辑关系。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics

,Matthew Y. Chen,The primacy of rhythm in verse: a linguistic perspective,1980,诗的节奏的首要性可以从多方靣找到证明。以诗律的声调而言轻拍字的分平仄比较自由。这就是传统所谓的「一三五不论」（见苐二节）。从语音上看来诗歌朗诵中的连续变调往往受到诗句中有节奏性的句逗的影响。许多本来费解的连续变调现象都可以看成为诗的节奏所產生的「调组」（苐三至四节）至于诗的语法，诗句中的主要词组通常和节奏单位－如「小节」和「半句」－相配合（苐五节）。一些诸如「倒装句」的反常现象也可以从诗律和语法一致的趋势找到合理的解释（苐六节）。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics
,Moira Yip,The metrical structure of regulated verse,1980,这篇文章为陈渊泉（1979）有关汉语诗律的论点提供证据。並以他的理论把（一）律诗朗诵时的节奏（二）王力所谓“一三五不论　二四六分明”的原则以及（三）句法与格律的相互关系等三个问题放在一起统一处理。依此理论本文同时说明何以诗词在吟诵之时使用轻声的机会極少。这是因为音步结构树上的节有強（S）弱（W）之分而轻声不能出现在強节之下的缘故。同一理论也可以解釋诗人什么时候可以脫离正常的格律來作诗，什么时候不可以。我们常见一行诗中二、四字同调而违反正规这也可以用同样的理由來说明。最后本文以一個应用極广的原则把汉语律诗结构树上的各个节统一规定为強或弱。如此一來陈文中所提议有关调类排列的一个限制便屬不必而可以免除了。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics

,Wayne Schlepp,Tentative remarks on chinese metrics,1980,本文研讨中国诗学中的「拍板」问题。首先论及拍踏与节奏中之某些音节的具体关系。次者再探讨拍板与「平仄」的关系。按文中所提出的拍板系统轻重音和长短音皆可用以表现出拍板的特色。重音一般落于节奏的第一位长音在第二位。有的诗像民歌儿童诗歌楽府等輕重的表现较为显明而律诗、词、曲等中长短则较为重要。雖然「平仄」素被认为律诗之一种重要特性可是按文中的系统拍板卻佔较重要之地位而平仄则次之。平仄非律诗之主体其特別用处是使「四模型句」中的每一句都有异样的形式因之给律诗加以別的诗所无之色彩。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics
,Conal D. Boyce,Min sandhi in verse recitation,1980,近年来关于闽南语基本变调的文章已经发表了不少。本文讲的是用闽南语朗诵诗词时所观察到的变调现象。这种变调的规律和古代作诗所谓的「一三五不论」的规律似乎有些共同点。两者之间或许只是巧合而已，但也可能反映若干历史上的关系。这问题的结论尚待更深一步的研究。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics
,Ove Lorentz,The conflicting tone patterns of chinese regulated verse,1980,中国律诗这种严格但不对称的音调格式可以看成起因于声韵格式和字里行间相似與相异的基本音调转換时的一种冲突。这种冲突可以用某种转換的方法來解決。在这个解決方法中被用來注明音调的“韵律树”是可以免除的。但是為了要说明一般的读韵相对应的文章构成法的格式和產生強音與弱音位置的限制我们仍然需要一套体系來解釋句子中组成要素之间的相对強度。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics
,Shou-hsin Teng,Remarks on cleft sentences in chinese,1979,本文为汉语分裂句做出初步的整理与分析。在语意上，在语法上，我们皆可明晰地将分裂句及判断句之间的界限划分出来。本文並举出语法现象反对传统上将‘是…的’句型做为分裂句的论点。在分析上，我们指出桥本的包孕句分析的种种困难。但我们同时指出她的困难可用单句分析解决。但是单句分析需应用句型变形将系词介绍至句中；这种系词的来源无法解释为何分裂句中的系词仍具有一般动词所显示的一系列的语法特徵。,Journal of Chinese Linguistics

From a survey of over a thousand ‘diapoints’ emerges a clear distributional pattern of nasal vowels (NV's): they tend to occupy the lower portion of the vowel space. Three hypotheses are proposed to explain this phenomenon: (1) Nasalization tends to spread from low to high vowels, as a result, low NV's are the most likely to emerge. (2) De nasalization progresses in the opposite direction; low NV's are, therefore, the most likely to survive the attrition. (3) NV's tend to fall; consequently, NV's tend to popu late the lower corner of the vowel triangle.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

,Charles N. Li; Sandra A. Thompson,Co-verbs in mandarin chinese: verbs or prepositions?,1974,"They are semantically like prepositions, but many of them are homophonous with verbs; because of these two properties, grammarians have not been able to agree on their classification. Since there is an evident similarity of certain co-verbs to verbs being due to the historical evolution of the present-day co-verbs from earlier verbs, the semantic arguments in favor of regarding co-verbs as prepositions are compelling. These arguments include the fact that co-verbs have prepositional meanings, and that sentences containing co-verbs are not two-clause sentences. A comparison with the two-clause 'serial verb' constructions in Mandarin makes this clear. The synchronic and diachronic facts regarding Mandarin co-verbs find an exact parallel in the Kwa languages of West Africa.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics
,Robert L. Cheng,Causative constructions in taiwanese,1974,"Defining the causative construction as a construction that conveys the meaning 'an event causes another event', this paper describes various syntactic constructions that answer the semantic definition. Two major types of causative constructions, intentional and unintentional, are distinguished. The semantic content of all intentional causative constructions is analyzed as Agent ((Event_1) hō· Event_2) or 'Agent ((Event_1) causes Event_2)', while that of the unintentional ones is analyzed as Event1 (hō· Event_2), or 'Event_1 (causes Event_2)'. Though relics of once-productive constructions are abundant in the language, one-verb causative constructions are found to be no longer productive. The two-verb causative constructions are divided into three types: those that cannot take conjunction hō 'in order that', those that take it obligatorily, and those that take it optionally. The etymon hō is also used as a verb and the dative case marker. Constructions using hō in such functions are also regarded as causative constructions since their meanings fit our semantic definition of the intentional causative construction.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The VP_1 states an action whose goal is fulfilled by the action performed in VP_2. The relevance of studies in the philosophy of action plays an important role in the understanding of such sentences.",Journal of Chinese Linguistics

The idea of convening a meeting to present and discuss papers bearing on the ultimate genetic relationship of Chinese to the Tibeto-Burman languages developed naturally in the course of several conversations held at Yale in 1967-68 among Samuel Martin, Roy Andrew Miller, Hugh Stimson, and myself. One of the chief motivations for this enterprise was the emergence from linguistic retirement of the pioneer Sino Tibetanist Paul K. Benedict. Benedict had abandoned linguistics for psychiatry in the 1940's, after having compiled (in collaboration with Robert Shafer, and under the overall direction of Alfred Kroeber) a vast compendium of everything that was then known about Tibeto-Burman, working out the basic sound-correspondences among the languages in the various subgroups of the family. 1 In addition, he had proposed a radical new genetic grouping for the languages of Southeast Asia,2 removing Thai and its relatives from Sino-Tibetan entirely, and grouping them rather with Malayo-Polynesian in a new group which he now calls Austro-Thai.3",Journal of Chinese Linguistics
