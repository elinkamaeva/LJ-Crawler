Using networks and hypergraphs to explore Māori loanwords in New Zealand English,2023,"Networks are being used to model an increasingly diverse range of real-world phenomena. This paper introduces an exploratory approach to studying loanwords in relation to one another, using networks of co-occurrence. While traditional studies treat individual loanwords as discrete items, we show that insights can be gained by focusing on the various loanwords that co-occur within each text in a corpus, especially when leveraging the notion of a hypergraph. Our research involves a case-study of New Zealand English (NZE), which borrows Indigenous Māori words on a large scale. We use a topic-constrained corpus to show that: (i) Māori loanword types tend not to occur by themselves in a text; (ii) infrequent loanwords are nearly always accompanied by frequent loanwords; and (iii) it is not uncommon for texts to contain a mixture of listed and unlisted loanwords, suggesting that NZE is still riding a wave of borrowing importation from Māori.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

We conducted the analysis the using a large Spanish-English parallel corpus. First, we used this corpus to obtain a list of parenthetical discourse markers in each language. Then, we used it as a “semantic mirror”, inspecting the English equivalences and assessing which Spanish discourse markers fulfil a similar function in discourse and vice versa. The result of this procedure is an emerging categorisation of discourse markers. The main contribution is to offer empirical evidence for the adequacy of existing manually-compiled taxonomies and the potential for discovery of new, unaccounted categories. In this article we focus on units pertaining to the Spanish language but, since the method is purely quantitative, it is possible to apply it to different languages as well.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The rise of YOU BET as a pragmatic marker,2023,"This article studies you bet and related phrases when they are used as a parenthetical and as a free-standing response. Drawing on a range of corpora, we provide both contemporary and historical perspectives on the set of pragmatic expressions that has largely escaped scholars’ attention. Synchronically, we demonstrate that they are colloquial American pragmatic markers to express speaker certainty/affirmation or to respond to thanks. Diachronically, these markers are hypothesized to have developed out of main clause usage with a clausal complement (‘the matrix clause hypothesis’); however, our historical corpus evidence does not straightforwardly support this hypothesis. Instead, we suggest that multiple constructions might have been involved in the emergence of the pragmatic markers, namely, wh-interrogatives (e.g. what will you bet (that) …?), modal constructions (e.g. you may/can bet (that) …), and main clauses with a reduced complement (e.g. You bet I do).",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

A mixed-effects logistic regression analysis,2023,"This study investigates the factors significantly constraining dative alternation in Chinese by adopting mixed-effects logistic regression modelling. The analysis showed that such factors significantly affected the choice of dative variants in Chinese, including the animacy, pronominality, and definiteness of the recipient, the accessibility and concreteness of the theme, and the length difference between the theme and the recipient. Findings were compared with those for the English dative alternation discussed in the literature. When the theme was recoverable from context or shorter than the recipient, the prepositional dative construction was preferred in both English and Chinese. This can be explained by the principles of end-focus and end-weight. However, when the recipient was animate or definite, the double object construction was preferred in English, while the prepositional dative construction was more likely to be used in Chinese. This divergence is due to the different syntactic and semantic features of their recipient markers.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Communicatively relevant odours and odorants,2023,"The sense of smell has been relatively neglected in the Western research. It is not regarded as particularly useful compared to the perceived importance of senses like sight, sound, and touch. Correspondingly, English speakers are ill-equipped to describe qualities of smells, instead invoking entities that share similar olfactory qualities, e.g. like roses. This raises the question: which odours do English speakers frequently refer to, and which terms describe them? This corpus-driven study looks at nouns in olfactory contexts, and the conceptual domains they fall into. Results show that speakers invoke different smells according to context: when talking about a smell they perceive, when describing a smell, or in a description of another smell, which demonstrates the differential communicative functions of smells. Further analysis shows that smells that are described are more variable than those used as descriptors, and smells being used to describe are more emotional using psychometric norming data.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

commonness based on corpus data. In addition, dispersion measures do not only reflect what sort of distribution the frequency

Verb-attached PPs in the history of English,2023,"Prepositional phrases (PPs) play an important part in English argument structure constructions, but pose considerable challenges for linguistic investigations of any kind. In addition to the fact that PP-attachment is generally notoriously difficult to model computationally, a particularly striking methodological challenge in investigating verb-dependent PPs across (synchronic and/or diachronic) corpora is that such cross-corpus studies may have to rely on material annotated with different tools. This study evaluates the impact that such differences in corpus annotation may have on retrieval of verb-attached PPs by means of data from Early and Late Modern English corpora. Our intrinsic (recall/precision) and extrinsic parser evaluation shows that annotation does play a role, but that the noise introduced is negligible as far as frequency developments are concerned.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Part of speech tags that are steadily increasing or decreasing in all five or the latest three corpora are examined via concordance lines and their distributions in order to identify long-standing and emerging trends in British English. The analysis points to the continuation of some trends (such as declines in modal verbs and titles of address), along with newer trends like the rise of first person pronouns.

By examining annotation uncertainty in more detail, we identify the sources, deepen our understanding of the nature and different types of uncertainty encountered in daily annotation practice, and discuss practical implications of our theoretical findings.

However, the interface between CL and multimodal speech-gesture studies remains underexplored. One fundamental question is whether
it is possible, and even appropriate, to apply the theories and paradigms established based on textual data to multimodal data. To
explore this, we examine how CL can assist investigating lexico-grammatical patterns of speech co-occurring with a recurrent
gesture (i.e. the circular gesture). Sinclair’s (1996) unit of meaning model is used to
describe the co-gestural speech patterns. The study draws on a subset of the Nottingham Multimodal Corpus, in which 570 instances
of circular gestures and their co-occurring speech are identified and analysed. We argue that Sinclair’s unit of meaning model can
be extended to include speech-gesture patterns, and that those descriptions enable a more nuanced understanding of meaning in

Very short texts are known to be problematic for many statistical methods, so understanding their nature is important for the corpus-linguistic study of social media, where most contributions are short. I show that the frequencies of linguistic features change with comment length, even between longer comments, although longer texts are often considered similar in statistical terms. Moreover, I classify the variation found between short comments of different lengths into two main patterns, although other patterns can also be found, and there is variation even within these patterns. Furthermore, I interpret the observed differences in terms of register variation. For example, shorter comments appear to be more casual and less edited in terms of their feature makeup, whereas narrative and informational registers seem to favor longer comments.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

These longer expressions may not only have a different structure but may also carry out a different functional role.

Syntactic and semantic restrictions suggest that the usage of stand and ausstehen in the relevant sense is older than other semantically similar verbs (e.g. English tolerate, German leiden), while quantitative evidence from corpora shows that the can’t stand and nicht ausstehen können constructions are both colligationally stronger than lexical competitors. Evidence from the history of stand indicates that the lexeme stand in the Germanic and other Indo-European languages has a long history of being employed in the relevant sense. The restrictions on usage and the colligational strength of the respective English and German constructions are thus argued to result from the antiquity of the construction and functional competition from other lexemes.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The MCA approach to keywords deals with a major issue with the use of keywords to identify discourses: the allocation of individual keywords to multiple discourses. Yet, as this paper demonstrates, the approach also allows us to observe variation in the prevalence of discourses over time. The MCA approach to keywords allows the allocation of individual texts to multiple discourses based on patterns of keyword co-occurrence. Metadata in the corpus data analysed (here, UK newspaper articles about Islam) can then be used to map those discourses over time, resulting in a clear view of how the discourses vary relative to one another as time progresses.

We map meaning onto quads as ‘discursive concepts’, which encompass encyclopaedic semantics, pragmatics, and context. We investigate a high-frequency quad with high co-occurrence strength in EEBO-TCP: world-heaven-earth-power. We conduct semantic and pragmatic analysis to generate hypotheses regarding discursive change. The quad’s components are semantically underspecified; thus, although the quad indicates a discursive concept, each instantiation of the quad is variable, contingent, and dependent upon context and pragmatic processes for interpretation. We observe how the vague lexemes that constitute building blocks of religious discourse are employed to generate new, timely secular discourses; and we argue that semantic underspecification is the site and source of discursive change. Indeed, the volatile, unstable nature of the component lexical meanings renders them indispensable to early modern debate.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Our results confirm that -ity gained ground first in written registers and then spread towards speech-related registers, and we are able to time this change more accurately thanks to a novel periodisation.

In the current paper, a different approach is taken. Rather than examining co-occurrences between a cue and its observed responses, this paper explores the possibility that the cue’s holistic collocational environment shapes its associative profile. Regression modelling demonstrates that the predictability of this textual distribution is a significant predictor of variance in the cue’s response profile. Overall, however, the amount of variance explained is small.

A study based on Link Grammar and Pattern Grammar,2022,"In the past few decades, researchers have paid increasing attention to automatic error detection in natural languages, but few have focused on developing an error-checking tool for EFL learners in China. Based on the theory of Pattern Grammar, this study formalizes verb patterns through Link Grammar, a formal grammatical system developed by Sleator and Temperley (1991), and reconstructs an Link Grammar verb dictionary to create an automatic checking tool for verb form errors in Chinese learners’ written English. The test results show that by importing more detailed pattern information of verbs in the Link Grammar dictionary, the Link Grammar parser can identify verb form errors more accurately and effectively than the original and the parsing capability of the Link Grammar parser is improved. The article shows that Pattern Grammar and Link Grammar can work together and be applied to the construction of error-checking tools for EFL learners with promising results.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

An indicator of minimally required sample size in productivity studies?,2022,"This article addresses one of the lesser-known productivity measures, namely the hapax / type ratio (HTR). Through a case study involving the Dutch semi-copula raken (“attain”), it is shown that the HTR more or less stabilizes from a certain sample size onwards. Moreover, this point of stabilization seems to coincide with an increased permanency of the hapaxes, i.e. the share of hapaxes that convert quickly to non-hapaxes is not as large as was the case at the beginning of the sampling process. Therefore, the stabilization of the HTR might be a good indicator of minimally required sample size in productivity studies, suggesting that the hapaxes are ‘non-incidental’ from this sample size onwards. However, I did not find a clear link between the onset of the stabilization of the HTR and the extent to which the inventory of types accounted for at the top of the frequency distribution is (quasi-)complete.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Currently, -yînz- first and foremost conveys deontic and epistemic possibility. It still prevails in these more subjective modal categories even though the prefix -andi-, a conditional marker in origin, has started to express epistemic possibility since the 1940s, and -sóból- deontic possibility since the 1970s.

different registers (including nine telecinematic ones: drama series, miniseries, movies, sitcoms, soap operas, general animation,
children’s animation, short-feature animation, and children’s and teens’ shows). The linguistic typology we present in this study is based
on the linguistic characteristics present in the individual programs, with no a priori textual categorizations. A cluster
analysis grouped the individual programs into clusters that shared similar dimensional profiles. The resulting typology comprises nine
different text types – namely Presentation of information, Opinion and discussion, Analysis and debate, Description, Interactive recount,
Engaging demonstration, Playful discourse, Simplified interaction, and Simulated conversation. The paper discusses and illustrates each text
type and considers how telecinematic discourse relates to each of them.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

A corpus linguistic analysis of the Australian Indigenous TV drama Redfern Now,2020,"This article presents a corpus-driven sociolinguistic study of Redfern Now – the first major television drama series commissioned, written, acted, directed and produced by Indigenous industry professionals in Australia. The study examines whether corpus linguistic keyword analysis can identify evidence for type indexicality (social demographics, personae) and trait indexicality (stance, personality), with particular attention paid to the potential indexing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander identity. More specifically, the study’s goal is to retrieve and analyse words that are associated with varieties of English in Australia, and with Australian Aboriginal Englishes in particular. To this end, a corpus with dialogue from Redfern Now is compared to a reference corpus of US television dialogue. Results show that Redfern Now features the use of easily recognisable and familiar words (e.g. blackfella[s], deadly; kinship terms), but also shows clear variation among characters. The case study concludes by evaluating the use of keyword analysis for identifying indexicality in telecinematic discourse.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

abstract, speech-act taxonomies devised by ordinary language philosophers like Austin and Searle. The aim of this article is to illustrate
how the use of such restricted taxonomies may lead to oversimplified or potentially misleading impressions regarding the communicative
functions expressed in spoken interaction, and to demonstrate how a more elaborate taxonomy, the DART taxonomy (Weisser, 2018), may help us gain better insights into the pragmatic strategies that occur in dialogues. To this end,
I will draw on a small sample of dialogues, both from a task-oriented domain and unconstrained interaction, and contrast selected speech-act
categorisations on the basis of Searle’s and the DART taxonomy, demonstrating the advantages that arise from using a more fine-grained
taxonomy to describe complex verbal exchanges.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

We develop a complex annotation scheme of pragmalinguistic categories on different levels of granularity and manually annotate a corpus of texts across various scientific disciplines. This is the basis for training recurrent neural networks to classify heuristic textual practices. Our experiments show that the annotation categories are robust enough to be recognised by our models which learn similarities of the sentence-surfaces represented as word embeddings. Our study aims at an iterative human-in-the-loop process in which manual-hermeneutic and algorithmic procedures mutually advance the insight process. It underlines the fact that the interaction between manual and automated methods opens up a promising field for further research, allowing interpretative analyses of complex pragmatic phenomena in large corpora.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

While it seems indisputable that for the majority of quantitative research foci, effect size is an essential element of statistical analysis, this paper argues that specifically for key word analysis in corpus linguistics, the means of reporting effect size must depend on the level of the unit of study of each investigation (single text, collection or large corpus). After exploring some main criticisms of the log-likelihood measure, this paper unpacks the parameters of different measures for keyness and how they might address underlying concerns. It maintains that for the exploration of foregrounded/deviant/salient/marked features in text, the use of log-likelihood scores to rank the results is still fit for purpose and coupled with Bayes Factors is a solid approach for key word analyses.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

not a universal phenomenon. Noun phrase postmodifying clauses exhibit a similar initial fall in the probability of successive
clauses modifying the same NP head, and embedding clauses modifying new NP heads. Successive postmodification

The results indicated that the structural and functional characteristics of the lexical bundles in the Pathway engineering materials were representative of the discourse features found in the general engineering corpus. This finding provides additional evidence of the overall appropriateness of the pedagogical materials selected for the Pathway course. Furthermore, the two engineering corpora also included a substantial number of bundles that were unique to the specific course materials, and, therefore, can potentially be targeted during language instruction.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

A Spoken BNC2014-based investigation of female and male usage of intensifiers,2017,"Since the late twentieth century, the usage of intensifiers, such as absolutely, very or slightly, has been investigated in relation to gender. Whereas previous literature has widely agreed that women and men do indeed use intensifiers differently, there has been some disagreement as to which gender uses them more frequently. Taking up this discussion, this study explores authentic data provided in the Spoken BNC2014S by investigating 39 intensifiers. After establishing the ten most frequently used intensifiers by women and men, these are subcategorized and investigated for gender and age effects. The results generally support earlier findings, however, they also illustrate that there is much interindividual variation and variation regarding individual intensifiers and that there are fascinating interactions with other variables such as age.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Using the Spoken BNC2014S, I ask whether speaker characteristics, including gender, age, education and occupation, might be correlated with the use of demonstrative clefts and with various aspects of their structure (preference for the distal or proximal demonstrative pronoun, use of negative polarity, and use of stance adverbs). Findings suggest that in British English, demonstrative cleft use is more likely to be present in the speech of male compared to female speakers, working adults in higher-skilled occupations compared to semi-skilled adults, and in adults of middle age compared to younger adults. This work shows that even highly abstract grammatical constructions can be sensitive to speaker preferences and linguistic communicative style.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This method partitions the history of a grammatical construction according to qualitative stages of productivity corresponding to different semantic sets of lexical items attested in it. Two case studies are presented. The first case study on the hell-construction (“Verb the hell out of NP”) shows that the semantic development of a construction does not always match that of its quantitative aspects, like token or type frequency. The second case study on the way-construction compares the results of the present method with those of collostructional analysis. It is shown that the former measures semantic changes and their chronology with greater precision. In sum, this method offers a promising approach to exploring semantic variation in the lexical fillers of constructions and to modelling constructional change.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This phenomenon is known as implicit causality (IC). Recent studies have shown that verbs’ causality biases closely correspond to the verbs’ semantic classes, as classified in VerbNet, a lexicon that groups verbs into classes on the basis of syntactic behavior. The current study further investigates the relationship between causality biases and semantic classes. Using corpus data we show that the collostruction strength between verbs and the syntactic constructions that VerbNet classes are based on can be a good predictor of causality bias. This result suggests that the relation between semantic class and causality bias is not a categorical matter; more typical members of the semantic class show a stronger causality bias than less typical members.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The case of MWDM extraction from the reference corpus of spoken Slovene,2017,"With expanding evidence on the formulaic nature of human communication, there is a growing need to extend discourse marker research to functionally analogue multi-word expressions. In contrast to the common qualitative approaches to discourse marker identification in corpora, this paper presents a corpus-driven semi-automatic approach to identification of multi-word discourse markers (MWDMs) in the reference corpus of spoken Slovene. Using eight statistical measures, we identified 173 structurally fixed discourse-marking MWEs, distinguished by a high number of tokens, a large proportion of grammatical words and semantic heterogeneity. This is a significantly longer list than would have been gained by manual inspection of smaller corpus samples. Although frequency-based methods produced satisfactory results, best precision in MWDM identification was achieved using the t-score association measure, while the overall poor performance of the mutual information suggests its inadequacy for extraction of MWDMs and other MWEs with similar lexical and distributional features.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The investigation involved a quantitative analysis of the use of four-word bundles, in terms of frequency, form, and function, across a range of genres (academic lectures and seminars) and disciplines (Medicine, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences). A qualitative analysis was also carried out to give an in-depth account of functional variations associated with one particular lexical bundle I don’t know if.

Integrating these two levels of analysis, while methodologically challenging, is not only innovative but also highly relevant to the investigation of spoken discourse in general and form-meaning patterns in particular. The aim of this paper is to provide corpus-based evidence of the register-sensitivity of DMs and other disfluencies (e.g. pauses, repetitions) and of their tendency to combine in recurrent clusters. These claims are supported by quantitative findings on the variation and combination of DMs with other (dis)fluency devices in DisFrEn, a richly annotated and comparable English-French corpus representative of eight different interaction settings.

The words that are most frequently accompanied by a manual gesture, when controlled for their total frequency, include unspecific spatial lexemes, various deictic words, and particles that express difficulty in word retrieval or formulation. Other linguistic items, including pronouns and verbs of cognition, show a strong dispreference for being gesture-accompanied. The second part of the paper shows that gestures do not occur within a fixed time window relative to the word(s) they relate to, but the preferred temporal distance varies with the type of functional relation that exists between the verbal and gestural channel.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In doing so, it examines to what extent lexis, level of expertise in academic writing and L1 transfer influence the distribution of the different realizations of stance under investigation. The results show that all three variables are important predictors. In addition, differences pertaining to information structure are found to influence the distribution of two largely synonymous constructions (disjuncts and the introductory it pattern).

However, their conceptual constructs are elusive and their linguistic realisation is not fully explored. A relatively overlooked feature is the “noun + that” structure, where a stance head noun takes a nominal complement clause (as advantage that in Flow cytometry offers the advantage that long term is available). This construction allows a writer to express authorial stance towards complement content and attribute a voice to that stance through pre-modification. This paper examines this construction in a corpus of 60 journal articles across six disciplines extracted from the BNC corpus. Developing an expressive classification of stance nouns and the possible voice categorisation, this study shows that the structure is not only widely used to project stance and voice, but that it displays considerable variation in the way that it is used to build knowledge across different disciplines.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In the present study a more inclusive definition is adopted and the number of intervening words is not limited. While there have been a small number of studies related to collocational frameworks there has been no attempt so far to see whether it is possible to describe their local grammars. To illustrate the feasibility of identifying the local grammars of collocational frameworks, four collocational frameworks are studied here: any … may, may … any, any … shall, and shall … any and their local grammars are identified and discussed.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

More specifically, trajectors in instances including the English prepositions in or on, or their Swedish equivalents i or på, are analyzed. On the structure of the inverse Moving Observer/Moving Time metaphors (Lakoff & Johnson 1999) instances such as these should be construed relative to a Moving Observer, and trajectors people that move relative to fixed durations of TIME (as reflected in e.g. when we come to launching the 4th edition in early 1990). My analysis, however, suggests that our understanding of TIME through SPACE is more nuanced than suggested by these metaphors. In this specific context, trajectors are not typically people in motion, but rather events or processes located in, or on, unit of time landmarks.

Based on a joint analysis of 303 lexical variables, which are semi-automatically extracted by means of a SVS, we find that lexical variation in the Brown family is systematically related to three lectal dimensions: discourse type (informative versus imaginative), standard variety (British English versus American English), and time period (1960s versus 1990s). It turns out that most lexical variables are sensitive to at least one of these three language-external dimensions, yet not every dimension has dedicated lexical variables: in particular, distinctive lexical variables for the real time dimension fail to emerge.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This is why this article attempts to identify the actual constraints on the use of many, by searching corpora for data for many and its competitor a lot of, with plural count nouns in positive sentences. Conducted within the conceptual framework of cognitive linguistics, the analysis suggests that quantities denoted by many are construed as heterogeneous and discrete, hence the relative affinity of many for nouns of place and time, as part of adverbial phrases. This core meaning may also account for many’s relative affinity for personal nouns in subject position.

Key issues and recommendations,2016,"This paper discusses key issues in the compilation of spoken language corpora in a computer-mediated communication (CMC) environment, using data from the Corpus of Academic Spoken English (CASE), a corpus of Skype conversations currently being compiled at Saarland University, Germany, in cooperation with European and US partners. Based on first findings, Skype is presented as a suitable tool for collecting informal spoken data. In addition, new recommendations concerning data compilation and transcription are put forward to supplement existing best practice as presented in Wynne (2005). We recommend the preservation of multimodal features during anonymisation, and the addition of annotation elements already at the transcription stage, particularly CMC-related discourse features, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) features (e.g. non-standard language and code-switching), as well as the inclusion of prosodic, paralinguistic, and non-verbal annotation. Additionally, we propose a layered corpus design in order to allow researchers to focus on specific annotation features.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Categorising the unconventional in POS-tagging the VOICE corpus,2016,"This paper reports on some issues encountered when using various ‘external points of reference’ in the development of POS-tagging guidelines for the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English (VOICE). VOICE is a corpus of spoken English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) containing naturally occurring, plurilingual data. As in all kinds of natural language use, speakers recorded in VOICE exploit available linguistic resources, often resulting in non-codified language use and language which is difficult to classify unambiguously. However, detailed tagging solutions for such phenomena are rarely reported. We discuss usefulness and limitations of external points of reference with regard to their suitability for POS-tagging VOICE and address methodological as well as practical issues, especially the handling of non-codified language use and different types of ambiguities. We suggest that the solutions found, and the theoretical approach adopted, could be relevant for the tagging of other spoken corpora.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Starting from this idea, this paper inspects more closely some actual practices in FOLK, namely the handling of legal (especially privacy protection) issues, the decisions taken for the transcription and annotation workflow, and the question of how to best disseminate a corpus like FOLK.

Using the reference corpus, the BE06, examples of different types of graphs were obtained and analysed in order to form an understanding of the sorts of relationships between words that occur in particular shapes. The analysis indicates that concepts from graph theory can be usefully integrated into corpus analysis of collocation as well as showing the potential for a more sophisticated understanding of the company that words keep.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

A corpus linguistic approach to the identification of swearing in computer mediated communication,2016,"The study of swearing has increased in the last decade, diversifying to include a wider range of data and methods of analysis. Nevertheless, certain types of data and specifically large corpora of computer mediated communication (CMC) have not been studied extensively. In this paper, we fill a gap in research by studying the use of swearwords in blog data, and illustrate ways of identifying swearing in a large corpus by taking context into account. This approach, based on the examination of shared and unique collocates of known expletives, facilitates the distinction of attestations of swearing from non-swearing in the case of polysemous lexemes, and the analysis of overlaps in usage and meaning of swearwords. This work therefore goes beyond basic sentiment analysis and offers new insights into the use of collocation for refining profanity filters, providing innovative perspectives on issues of growing importance as online interaction becomes more widespread.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

For each genre, I calculate what I call the ‘Exaggeration Quotient’ (instances of always and never divided by instances of often or frequently and rarely or infrequently, respectively) and the rate of negation of always. Large Exaggeration Quotients and low negation rates were associated with informality, a pattern explicable in terms of specific aspects of informal language that motivate exaggeration, including perceived accountability for accuracy.

Therefore, by examining individual variation, light can be shed on the nature of mental representation itself. This paper presents an individual differences study of semi-opaque derivations (e.g. ruthless) to establish whether their representations are mentally associated to those of fully segmentable forms with the same suffix (e.g. sightless). This way, a prediction of connectionist and exemplar models of morphology is tested, namely that to language users semi-opaque forms are likely to retain some degree of internal complexity, despite the fact that they are not segmentable. Using corpus data, it is demonstrated that individuals who rely more heavily on the segmentable forms are also more likely to use the semi-opaque forms. This pattern in the variation across individuals indicates that semi-opaque derivations are not represented independently of the derivational paradigm from which they historically derive.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

What a text means is determined by its intertextual links to previous texts, and by the traces it leaves in its subsequent interpretations. The practical approach of philology and the methodology of corpus linguistics provide the foundation of the task of interpretation, by establishing the textual evidence on which interpretation has to rest.

The results show that there is a high variability of GE form, but that most forms are rarely used. GEs are generally less frequent in public and formal settings, such as classes and radio and television informative broadcasts, and more frequent in private settings. Substantial differences are found not only between the two groups of GEs, adjunctive and disjunctive, but also between particular GE expressions. We argue that mere qualitative analysis of pragmatic expressions such as GEs is not sufficient for reliable conclusions, and that quantitative corpus analysis can provide additional insights into GE functions, especially considering the differences between the two groups of GEs, adjunctives and disjunctives, and between particular GE expressions.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Contrasting reading material, the importance of the “Research Article” is highly relevant, as it was the only genre that emerged in all seven disciplines.

To this effect, a corpus of argumentative essays written by advanced British students of German (WHiG) was compared with a corpus of argumentative essays written by German native speakers (Falko-L1). A corpus-driven analysis reveals a larger number of 3-grams in WHiG than in Falko-L1, which suggests that British advanced learners of German are more likely to use formulaic language in argumentative writing than their native-speaker counterparts. Secondly, by classifying the formulaic sequences according to their functions, this study finds that native speakers of German prefer discourse-structuring devices to stance expressions, whilst British advanced learners display the opposite preferences. Thirdly, the results show that learners of German make greater use of macro-discourse-structuring devices and cautious language, whereas native speakers favour micro-discourse structuring devices and tend to use more direct language.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

To facilitate this analysis, we have developed a multiplatform, freeware software tool called ProtAnt that analyses the texts, generates a ranked list of keywords based on statistical significance and effect size, and then orders the texts by the number of keywords in them. We describe various experiments that demonstrate the ProtAnt analysis is effective not only at identifying prototypical texts, but also identifying outlier texts that may need to be removed from a target corpus.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The main aim of this case study is to explore whether systematic identification of repetitive textual features in a source language may be a beneficial procedure for translators of literary texts. The underlying assumption is that, in their complexity, not all repetitive features are necessarily easily noticeable. Repetitiveness here is identified with cluster and keyword analysis that are subsequently considered in synergy. Relevant translation solutions are examined. Though repetition plays a central role in the novel, translators show a marked stylistic strategy to avoid them.

These nouns share the property of ‘shell-nounhood’, associated with their ability to package and characterise complex discourse segments. One broad genre where this ability is widely exploited is academic discourse, which favours a markedly nominal cohesive style. Despite the extensive use of academic corpora in the study of shell-nounhood, the research focus has been primarily on specific sub-genres, formal patterns and rhetorical functions. This paper critically reviews the available evidence on this genre, using the corpora from which such evidence was obtained as its basic organising principle. In so doing, it uncovers some of the gaps to be addressed by future research, thereby setting the stage for more comprehensive descriptions that may usher in new pedagogies for the teaching of this crucial aspect of lexical cohesion in academic discourse.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

On the basis of two corpora of contemporary pop songs by male and female artists, respectively, the present paper explores discourses of femininity and masculinity as represented in the lyrics of pop songs. It is shown that although the two corpora behave surprisingly similarly in some respects, the way in which male and female artists refer to themselves or to the opposite sex might contribute to the consolidation of unfavourable roles for women.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

From this perspective, the development of many discourse markers can be understood as involving a process of increasing syntactic de-categorialization (Hopper 1991) as the grammaticalizing element loses its original grammatical constraints and comes to function as a marker at the level of discourse. We test the hypothesis that discourse marker grammaticalization results in largely unconstrained ordering possibilities. Our analysis shows that, on the contrary, discourse marker sequencing is highly constrained. We interpret these constraints in terms of Auer’s (1996) model of discourse marker grammaticalization. Discourse marker sequencing is characterized by strong persistence of a marker’s original syntactic category and reflects its specific grammaticalization trajectory.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The present paper explores whether these corpora — and the associated lists — are unequivocally more representative. Corpus design considerations have usually focused on issues of external representativeness (representing the target discourse domain), while disregarding issues of internal representativeness (whether the corpus permits reliable descriptions of linguistic variation). This disregard may be especially problematic for studies of lexical variation, where it is difficult to achieve stable, reliable results from corpus analysis. The present paper illustrates these challenges through experiments based on analysis of a corpus representing a highly restricted discourse domain: university-level introductory psychology textbooks. The results indicate that corpus design and composition has a much greater influence on lexical variation than previously recognized, highlighting the need to evaluate internal representativeness in quantitative corpus-based research.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In two case studies for Dutch and German, we show that it automatically identifies the correct synonym for 31% and 25% of the target words, respectively. A manual error analysis moreover indicates that many additional synonyms are very close in the distributional model, while most other distributional neighbours are semantically related to the target word along other dimensions than synonymy.

Corpus frequency may offer a good basis for item selection, if a reliable relationship can be demonstrated between frequency and learner knowledge. However, such a relationship is difficult to establish satisfactorily, given the small number of items and narrow range of test-takers involved in any individual study. In this study, a meta-analysis is used to determine the correlation between learner knowledge and frequency data across nineteen previously-reported tests. Frequency is shown to correlate moderately with knowledge, but the strength of this correlation varies widely across corpora. Strength of association measures (such as mutual information) do not to correlate with learner knowledge. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for collocation testing and models of collocation learning.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Consequently, a variable’s real effect can be concealed when studied in isolation because of the exclusion of the impact of other potentially confounding variables. Analyzing a variational case study, the alternation between inflected and uninflected attributive adjectives in Dutch, it will be demonstrated how confounding variables alter the impact of explanatory variables on the response variable, resulting in spurious effects in the bivariate analyses. Multiple Correspondence Analysis will be used as a heuristic tool to unveil the association patterns between explanatory variables in the data matrix which induce the spurious effects. Based on these findings, we will argue for a thorough analysis of the database patterns to gain insight in the underlying associations between explanatory variables before modeling their real impact on the response variable in a multivariate model.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The particular hypotheses tested concern the source of generalised conversational implicatures with quantifier some. Is the “some and not all” meaning of some a default interpretation of this item or a requirement of certain contexts? The defaultist approach (Levinson 2000, Chierchia 2004) would predict a preponderance of implicatures in the uses of some, whereas the contextualist approach (Sperber & Wilson 1986; Carston 1988, 2002) would predict that the implicature be found only with identifiable contextual triggers. The analysis of attested usage from the Bergen Corpus of London Teenage English (COLT) is shown to invalidate the former and to support the latter hypothesis. The workings of conversational implicatures are argued to be better understandable through corpus investigation than by recourse to decontextualized, self-fabricated, stock examples.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

It is widely contended that the relative order of satellites is motivated by three general principles: information status, length and the proximity principle. The proximity principle maintains that the placement of satellites is motivated by their semantic relationship with the sentence verb. We investigated the effect of the proximity principle on the relative placement of 8 different satellite classes based on a corpus sample of 202 combinations of two satellites retrieved from the Corpus of Spoken Dutch. The exact binomial test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed orders. Our main results corroborate the hypothesis that the proximity principle influences satellite ordering. We also found, however, that the placement of certain satellite classes appeared very restricted, which suggests that the proximity principle does not play an active role in their placement.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Instead of using a predefined monolingual sense-inventory, we use a language-independent framework by deriving the senses of a given word from word alignments on a multilingual parallel corpus, which we made available for corpus linguistics research. We built five WSD systems with English as the input language and translations in five supported languages (viz. French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish and German) as senses. The systems incorporate both binary translation features and local context features. The experimental results are very competitive, which confirms our initial hypothesis that each language contributes to the disambiguation of polysemous words. Because our system extracts all information from the parallel corpus, it offers a flexible language-independent approach, which implicitly deals with the sense distinctness issue and allows us to bypass the knowledge acquisition bottleneck for WSD.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The analysis focuses on the quantitative and qualitative use of pronouns, subject placeholders, as well as verbs and inanimate nouns that frequently occur in academic writing. The findings indicate that even advanced learners are insecure about the (non-)representation of authorship in academic texts, but lack the resources to report events and findings without mentioning an author-agent. The learner data evidence a significant overrepresentation of first person pronouns and subject placeholders as default strategies to suppress the author-agent. This imbalanced clustering is argued to be due to a significant underrepresentation of constructions with inanimate nouns as subjects that are preferred reporting devices in abstracts and research articles in the humanities.

Results are in line with a usage-based view of language that recognizes the active role that the first language (L1) may play in the acquisition of a foreign language. The different manifestations of L1 influence displayed in the learners’ idiosyncratic use of lexical bundles are traced back to various properties of French words, including their collocational use, lexico-grammatical patterns, function, discourse conventions, and frequency of use.

This study extends prior investigation of complement clauses to examine their distribution across different sections of a corpus of research articles in social science. The social action of each section is partially achieved through what the different voices in the different sections of the article talk about, and the subtle variations in the stance of the author and other voices across sections. This study finds that use of reporting verbs is nuanced according to authors’ purposes in different sections, and also according to the source of the proposition in the that-clause.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This article investigates the lexical bundles found in four legal corpora: academic law, case law, legislation, and documents. Major differences are brought to light between the type of bundles that are found, and the roles they have in the text. Academic legal writing uses relatively little formulaic language. Case law uses noun phrase bundles relating to agents, documents and actions, as well as many extended prepositional phrases. Legislation and documents contain many noun phrase bundles, and verb phrase bundles with a deontic or referential function. The function of these different types of bundle as parts of a schematic frame or as slot-fillers is discussed.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

It deals with T-universals (Chesterman 2004), with emphasis on the simplification hypothesis, as manifested in the core patterns of lexical use (Laviosa 1998) and the levelling out hypothesis (Baker 1996). To that end, the purpose-designed corpora, each with approximately 350,000 tokens, of contemporary translational and non-translational literary Polish were compiled. The results confirm the simplification and the levelling out hypotheses but only with reference to the mean sentence length and variance for the mean sentence length. On the other hand, the results of multivariate analyses (Principal Components Analysis and Cluster Analysis) confirm the levelling out hypothesis that translations are more alike as compared with native texts.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

An earlier paper in this journal used a quantitative literature survey to examine how far in practice the newer trend towards use by linguists of corpora and other empirical data sources had progressed. The result was ambiguous: a trend towards greater empiricism had occurred since about 1970, but around the turn of the century it appeared to have reversed, and the end of the period surveyed (2002) fell so soon thereafter that it was hard to guess whether this reversal was a blip or a long-term change. With a further decade of linguistic literature to examine, the present paper repeats the survey using a more systematic sampling technique, and this yields results that are much more clearcut than those of the earlier paper.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

On the ADV1 and ADV1 construction with adverbs of direction in English,2013,"This study discusses an adverbial pattern which has so far been largely overlooked, namely ADV1 and ADV1, as in again and again, on and on and over and over. The paper is primarily based on the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) and the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). The data show that these patterns follow typical paths of change, such as a movement towards more abstract meanings (metaphorization; over and over increasingly referring to repetition rather than to physical motion), lexicalization (e.g. up and up being used as a noun with idiosyncratic meaning in on the up and up), subjectification (e.g. on and on expressing negative connotations), iconic variation (again and again and again referring to multiple repetitions), simplification (loss of again after over and over), and the development of discourse functions (and on and on meaning “and so on”).",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Patterns and distributions of suspensions in Dickens’s novels,2013,"This paper addresses relations between lexico-grammatical patterns and texts. Our focus is on a specific linguistic unit, the ‘suspended quotation’ (or ‘suspension’), which has received particular attention in Dickens studies. The suspended quotation refers to an interruption of a fictional character’s speech by the narrator with a sequence of at least five words. We show how corpus linguistic methods can help to systematically study suspensions in a corpus of Dickens’s novels: we investigate relationships between patterns of body language presentation and suspensions; we consider the distribution of suspensions across novels; and we illustrate how patterns in suspensions relate to meanings of reporting verbs. Overall, we argue that suspensions are discernible units that contribute to meaningful patterns in narrative prose.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

But there is little agreement over their definition and measurement, or on methods of corpus comparison. We argue that replicable research must be grounded upon operational definitions in statistical terms. We adopt an experimental design and apply four different corpus-analytic measures, variously based upon n-gram frequency (Frequency-grams), association (MI-grams), phrase-frames (P-frames), and native norm (items in the Academic Formulas List – AFL-grams), to samples of first and second language writing in order to examine and compare knowledge of formulas in first and second language acquisition as a function of proficiency and language background.

Few previous studies have attempted to directly identify the full set of discontinuous sequences in a corpus. In the present study, we work towards that goal, using a corpus-driven approach to identify the set of recurrent four-word continuous and discontinuous patterns in corpora of conversation and academic writing. This direct computational analysis of the corpora reveals a more complete set of frames than alternative approaches, resulting in the documentation of highly frequent frames that have not been identified in previous research.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

After a discussion of the parameters underlying the notion of collocation, the paper has three main parts. First, I argue that corpus linguistics would benefit from taking more seriously the understudied fact that collocations are not necessarily symmetric, as most association measures imply. Also, I introduce an association measure from the associative learning literature that can identify asymmetric collocations and show that it can also distinguish collocations with high and low association strengths well. Second, I summarize some advantages of this measure and brainstorm about ways in which it can help re-examine previous studies as well as support further applications. Finally, I adopt a broader perspective and discuss a variety of ways in which all association measures – directional or not – in corpus linguistics should be improved in order for us to obtain better and more reliable results.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Major differences between languages were observed for overall use and for statements of results, comparison of current and previous findings, and metatext. From a cross-disciplinary viewpoint, biomedical research articles exhibited less self-promotion than previously reported for biology. Qualitative analysis revealed that first-person verbs in English were frequently associated with self-promotion whereas English possessives and all exclusive use in Spanish served to attribute responsibility for statements and to harmonise the multiple voices in the polyphonic discourse of biomedical Discussions.

The analysis focuses on the theme of depression, qualitatively examining how adolescents communicate psychological distress to health professionals. The study’s findings relate how the adolescents situate their accounts around two recurring constructs: “I am depressed” and “I have depression”. These formulations encode different perspectives and meaning making with regard to the conceptualisation of depression, the former describing depressive experiences as a reaction to negative life events, the latter portraying depression as a pathology originating within the individual. Thus the language choices employed by adolescents can be seen to reflect not only the personal and social contexts in which their depression is situated, but also reflect broader contemporary attitudes to mental health, specifically the sociocultural trend of psychiatrization, whereby sadness is constructed as a clinical problem rather than an unavoidable facet of everyday life.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Using the corpus procedures of frequency analysis, concordance contextual analysis, collocational analysis, and a variation on distinctive-collexeme analysis, we revisit the often under-supported assertion that RISK is semantically negative, and then investigate the semantic potential for good risk, a phenomenon associated with economic and adventuring sectors. Data suggest that RISK is genre sensitive, predominantly negative, and heavily medical in shared meaning across genres, and further, that evidence for good risk is minimal. A phrase of interest in recent corpus work — RISK worth taking — is shown to be sensitive perhaps more to constructional constraints than to semantic prosody.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Starting with semantic aspects, including the relationship between N-like and like an N, it then reports on the productivity of -like adjectives by discussing the kinds of nouns to which -like is added, along with the distributions of individual formations in the Bank of English corpus. It next draws attention to the marked collocational patterns in which -like adjectives occur. These relate both to sets of items collocating with individual -like adjectives, and to subsets of -like adjectives collocating with individual nouns. There are implications in these bidirectional collocational patterns, it is argued, for studies of productivity and lexicalization: in particular that collocational constraints may exist at the level of morpheme, not just at the level of word or phrase.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In order to answer this question, this study employs a corpus-based approach to data collection and a statistical approach to data analysis. Based on a spatial autocorrelation analysis of the values of eleven measures of contraction across a 25 million word corpus of letters to the editor representing the language of 200 cities from across the contiguous United States, two primary regional patterns were identified: easterners tend to produce relatively few standard contractions (not contraction, verb contraction) compared to westerners, and northeasterners tend to produce relatively few non-standard contractions (to contraction, non-standard not contraction) compared to southeasterners. These findings demonstrate that regional linguistic variation exists in written Standard American English and that regional linguistic variation is more common than is generally assumed.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

By tracking a person’s specific (inter)actions over time and place, the analysis of such “ubiquitous” corpora enables more detailed investigations of the interface between different communicative modes.This paper outlines some of the ways in which multi-modal, heterogeneous corpora can be utilised in corpus-based analyses of language-in-use and how we can construct richer descriptions of language use in relation to context. The paper further illustrates how the compilation of such corpora may enable us to extrapolate further information about communication across different speakers, media and environments, helping to generate useful insights into the extent to which everyday language and communicative choices are determined by different spatial, temporal and social contexts.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Beginning with CL and focusing largely on words and combinations of words, we then use CA to highlight pertinent interactional features. Our methodology follows an iterative process: from CL to CA, back to CL and so on.

Corpus linguistic tools such as word frequency lists allow the researcher to construct a detailed “pragmatic profile” of a word, cluster or act. This, coupled with the fact that most corpora are constructed to be representative of a particular language variety, facilitates an accurate account of language-use differences across various social categories. Pragmatic analysis relies heavily on context for its interpretation. Therefore, an illustrative case study of two corpora representing spoken language recorded in the home environment, one from a middle class Irish family and one from a family from the Irish Traveller Community will be utilised in order to elucidate the benefits of the synergy of corpus linguistics and variational pragmatics. Specifically, the variational distribution of the occurrences of hedges across these two distinct cultural groupings will be examined.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Since the distribution of these prepositions in native English is more differentiated than might be suggested by the standard pedagogical reference works, implications for English language teaching are suggested.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

It shows that the so-called filled pauses er/uh and erm/um are sociolinguistic markers that differentiate between registers of English and along gender, age and socio-economic class. Men, older people and educated speakers use more fillers than women, younger speakers and less educated speakers. Nasalization is used more often by women, younger speakers and more educated speakers. These sociolinguistic factors can probably partly explain the fact that the use of fillers is higher in the LLC and the context-governed sample of the BNC than in the demographic sample of the BNC. It is argued that a more positive view should be taken of fillers as planning signals, or planners, and that their functions should be submitted to careful discourse analytic study.

The study is based on the Narrative Corpus (NC), a recently created corpus of everyday narratives. The texts, which include both the narrative and some context, have been annotated for important textual components. The current analysis reveals that pauses are more frequent in conversational narrative than in general conversation. We suggest three factors that account for this high frequency: (i) the need for narrators, in the opening utterance of the story, to provide specific information to orient listeners to the situation in which the events unfolded, (ii) the need to coordinate narrative clauses to match the story events, and (iii) the preference of narrators to present speech, thought, emotion and gesture using direct-mode discourse presentation, which is more “dramatic” but also more costly in terms of reference resolution.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

They have a number of functions that help the speaker to organise the conversation and to express feelings and attitudes. Advanced EFL learners use frequent pragmatic markers such as well. However their use of well diverges from the native speaker norm. The present study uses data from the Swedish component of the LINDSEI corpus and its native speaker counterpart (LOCNEC) to examine similarities and differences between native and non-native speakers. The overall picture is that Swedish learners overuse well, although there are considerable individual differences. Thus learners use well above all as a fluency device to cope with speech management problems but underuse it for attitudinal purposes. Pragmatic markers cannot be taught in the same way as other lexical items but it is important to discuss how and where they are used.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

We detected lexical and grammatical categories which are especially error-prone as well as problematic aspects of fluency for all learners in the LINDSEI subcorpus, e.g. confusion in tense agreement across clauses or an overuse of unfilled pauses. In the ensuing qualitative analysis of five prototypical learners, no trend for a possible correlation of accuracy and fluency could be observed. Fifty native speakers’ ratings of these five learners revealed that the learner with an average performance across the investigated variables received the highest ratings for overall oral proficiency.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The purpose is to identify which features, or combinations of features, are common to more fluent speakers, and which are more idiosyncratic in nature. While the syntax of fluent speakers is not necessarily more complex than that of less fluent speakers, it is suggested that they are able to deliver content more efficiently through a combination of less hesitant speech and of lexical and syntactic choices that allow them to package information more economically.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

A grammar is defined as a set of lexical-syntactic rules at different levels of abstraction.

These parsers identify dependencies which can be used to improve corpus-based applications such as information extraction. At the end of this article, we describe an experiment which evaluates the efficiency of a dependency parser generated from a simple DepPattern grammar.

It argues for these 1st person self-references to be assigned not only a subjectivising function, but also one of expressing intersubjectivity.	In the two sets of data, the parenthetical constructions signify that the status of a particular piece of information encoded in a proposition is open for negotiation. Depending on their co-occurrences with discourse connectives they may boost or attenuate the pragmatic force of the contribution which they qualify.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

On the other hand, this paper shows that indicative-subjunctive alternation in that/que noun complement clauses is determined by the modality type of the governing noun.

A number of distinctive features of translational English in relation to native English have been uncovered. Nevertheless, research of this area has so far been confined largely to translational English translated from closely related European languages. If the features of translational language that have been reported on the basis of translated English are to be generalized as ‘translation universals’, it is of vital importance to find supporting evidence from non-European languages. Clearly, evidence from “genetically” distinct language pairs such as English and Chinese is arguably more convincing, if not indispensable. This article explores potential features of translational Chinese on the basis of two balanced monolingual comparable corpora of translated and native Mandarin Chinese. The implications of the study for translation universal hypotheses are also discussed.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In fact, the most important feature of a modern signed language corpus should be that it has been annotated rather than simply transcribed. Digital multi-media annotation software can now transform language recordings into machine-readable texts using gloss-based annotations without it first being necessary to transcribe these utterances, provided that sign tokens are identified and discriminated according to type. Further annotations can subsequently be appended to these units. However, unique identifiers of sign types (or ‘ID-glosses’) can only be used if a comprehensive reference lexical database of the language already exists. In order to create a basic multi-purpose reference signed language corpus, therefore, linguists should prioritize annotation using ID-glosses above transcription. The effort expended in creating a transcription that does not facilitate the unique identification of sign types will not result in a machine-readable corpus in any meaningful sense, contrary to expectations.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In non-moderated chat, which is clearly less formal, ne is used productively as a discursive-pragmatic marker. However, in moderated chat, which resembles more formal written French discourse, ne deletion rarely occurs. Although discussion fora are somewhere between the two types of chat on the continuum of sociolinguistic variation, there is a clear tendency for them to be slightly closer to the formal/written side, yet this mode of CMC displays the greatest amount of mode-internal variation.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The paper first surveys the methodological characteristics of corpus-driven research and then contrasts the linguistic characteristics of two types of multi-word sequences: ‘multi-word lexical collocations’ (combinations of content words) versus ‘multi-word formulaic sequences’ (incorporating both function words and content words). 	Building on this background, the primary focus of the paper is an empirical investigation of the ‘patterns’ represented by multi-word formulaic sequences. It turns out that the multi-word patterns typical of speech are fundamentally different from those typical of academic writing: patterns in conversation tend to be fixed sequences (including both function words and content words). In contrast, most patterns in academic writing are formulaic frames consisting of invariable function words with an intervening variable slot that is filled by content words.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

A special focus lies on methodological issues in the description of such markers, since their non-propositional meanings seem to require what is called a ‘combined corpus approach’, including written and spoken comparable data as well as translation corpora. It is argued that eigenlijk and en fait are best described as adversatives, at the intersection of “opposition” and “reformulation” which constitute their basic meanings, and from which other meanings such as “causality”, “counterexpectation”, “enhancement” and “attenuation” can be inferred. Evidence from all sets of corpora moreover suggests that it is the semantic underspecification of en fait and (especially) eigenlijk which ultimately accounts for their high level of polysemy.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Corpus linguistic techniques have been criticized on the grounds that they encourage a more bottom-up rather than top-down processing of text in which concordance lines are examined atomistically. One criticism levelled against corpus data is that a corpus presents language out of its original context. For this reason, some corpus linguists have underscored the importance of ‘pedagogic mediation’ to contextualize the data for the students’ own writing environment. Concerns relating to the inductive approach associated with corpus-based pedagogy have also been raised as this approach may not always be the most appropriate one. A final consideration relates to the issue of whether a corpus is always the most appropriate resource to use among the wealth of other resources available.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Taking Leech’s study as a starting point, this paper investigates twentieth century changes in modal verbs using the new and relatively unexplored TIME Magazine Corpus. Results show that while certain modal verbs have fallen in frequency, the overall pattern is one of growth. These changes may be accounted for by the increase of semi-modal verbs and shifts in usage. Results appear to lend support to the explanatory hypotheses of colloquialization, democratization and stylistic change. Investigation of discrepancies between results from the TIME Corpus and the Brown corpora yields important methodological implications. In particular, as a result of sampling variation, a diachronic comparison based on two data points may present an inaccurate picture of the overall trend.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Both of these points are supported by quantitative evidence from a corpus of front-page articles of the daily newspaper Utusan Malaysia. The paper also proposes an explanation for these tendencies by using the functional notion of ‘topic’ and the mechanism of competition. Specifically, tendencies (i) and (ii) above are claimed to result from the competition between the topicality and heaviness of the subject NP, and from the Constraint on ‘Topic-over-Topic’ Configuration (COTC) respectively. The proposed model with competition and COTC is applicable to other phenomena in Malay (apparent violations of the Definiteness Restriction) and other languages (restricted occurrence of the topic marker in some subordinate clauses in Japanese) as well.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

A general conclusion is that in the cases where there is no explicit information about the part of the message following the inserted backchannel, the message will nevertheless mostly be understood even at the backchannel insertion point.

Also although news has the lowest overall LA frequency among the five registers, it boasts the highest use of LAs that express simultaneity (e.g. meanwhile). Besides discussing new findings, the paper also addresses their implications for language description, learning, and teaching.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Using automatic tagging software that assigns part-of-speech and semantic field (domain) tags, a method is described which permits the extraction of key domains by applying the keyness calculation to tag frequency lists. The combination of the key words and key domains methods is shown to allow macroscopic analysis (the study of the characteristics of whole texts or varieties of language) to inform the microscopic level (focussing on the use of a particular linguistic feature) and thereby suggesting those linguistic features which should be investigated further. The resulting ‘data-driven’ approach presented here combines elements of both the ‘corpus-based’ and ‘corpus-driven’ paradigms in corpus linguistics. A web-based tool, Wmatrix, implementing the proposed method is applied in a case study: the comparison of UK 2001 general election manifestos of the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This paper presents a preliminary attempt at capturing the uses of the adverb really across spoken and written academic registers. The adverb really is examined with an eye to how its frequencies, meanings and uses vary across spoken and written academic discourse. The findings will also be interpreted in terms of variation across genres and disciplines. A quantitative analysis of this adverb reveals significant distributional trends across both academic genres and disciplines, and a qualitative analysis of concordance lines confirms that these trends are motivated by genre-specific purposes and disciplinary-specific practices, respectively.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

We argue that models that use different sources of information about unknown words, both structural and contextual, can be effective for handling different types of unknown words. We propose a rule-based model that uses information about the type, length, and internal structure of unknown words and combine it with two existing statistical models that use information about the POS context and component characters of unknown words respectively for this task. By combining the complementary strengths of the three models that use different sources of information, the hybrid model achieves an accuracy of 89%, a significant improvement over the best result reported in previous studies.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This investigation analysed transcriptions of telephone conversations drawn from the Australian and New Zealand sub-corpora of the International Corpus of English (ICE), and used the ICE corpus mark-up scheme to select potential targets. Chi-square analyses found listeners used single word backchannels more often than more elaborate forms; and Australian listeners produced more backchannels and more single forms. These findings were compared with reported usage by US English listeners, showing that while listeners worldwide draw from a common repertoire of backchannel forms, they differ in the complexity of the structures they use.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

If high frequency is associated with more differentiation on both sides, we expect, on the one hand, that a frequent function will have a high number of forms and, on the other, that a frequent form will have a high number of functions. Our study focuses on Russian nominals, in particular nouns, which exhibit both syncretism and inflectional allomorphy.

His argument rests on the observation that large corpora reveal a huge discrepancy between the predictions made by cognitive models of grammar and what actually happens in performance. This discrepancy cannot be explained away by appeal to encoding/processing deficiencies, but must be taken as reason to revise our view of grammar, especially by exploring its interdependence with lexis. In this he follows Halliday’s (1966) idea that every word has its own grammar. Sinclair’s 1991 paper on the word of (‘The meeting of lexis and grammar’) exemplifies his thinking in this area with particular energy and originality. Questioning the traditional classification of of as a preposition, he proposes a new, more semantically based, approach to the analysis of noun phrases traditionally said to contain postmodification of the head with an of-phrase, e.g. the horns of the bull. This chapter reviews Sinclair’s development as a grammarian, examines the arguments of the 1991 paper and suggests that while his work has been radically transformative in linguistics, it should not indefinitely avoid engaging with the problem of how best to represent what it is that we know when we say we know a language.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

While this is certainly a valid position when analysing the phenomenon of collocation, it does not really solve the problem for open choice issues. Not all language use can be subsumed under the idiom principle. The noun hatred, for instance, can co-occur with any discourse object for which hatred can be expressed. It can also co-occur with other lexical items standing for various circumstantial aspects. The grammatical structure itself often does not tell us whether we find expressed the object of hatred or some circumstantial aspect, as these structures tend to have more than one reading. Lexicogrammar, or local grammar, is more than equating a syntactic structure with a semantic pattern. We have to be aware of the different functions or readings a given grammatical structure can have. The framework of valency/dependency grammar can help us to make the necessary distinctions.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Problems of apparent counter-examples, when a word or unit does not have the semantic prosody that is typical of it, are discussed. The second point made is that the phenomena described as ‘semantic prosody’ can be regarded as observational data, but that they are often used to explain subjective reactions to a given text or to predict such reactions. The issues raised by these different uses are discussed. Finally, the pitfalls of using concordance lines to observe attitudinal language in highly opinionated texts are discussed.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Quantitative analyses of most frequent words and sequences of words, and of parts-of-speech, were conducted, and compared with their equivalents in two other sub-corpora of the BNC, of adult fiction and of newspaper texts. The main findings point to some characteristics of both the fiction corpora which are very similar, and which contrast markedly with the news texts. However, more nuanced comparison of concordance lines in which the frequent items occur reveal subtle but telling differences between their use in context in adult fiction and in fiction written for children.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Pauses are seen as a reflection of cognitive effort in lexical retrieval. The basic assumption is that a particular concept starts activating related concepts in a conceptual network via spreading activation. Pausing is assumed to be rare when spreading activation is at work, i.e. in the recall of multiword, or prefabricated, structures. The results show that pausing was significantly more frequent in connection with lexical search in computed as compared to prefabricated structures, thus indicating that prefabricated structures are stored and retrieved as wholes. The most important implication of the study is that the results give further support to John Sinclair’s proposed ‘idiom principle’, according to which strings that would appear to be analyzable into segments nevertheless constitute single choices.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

It is argued here that difficulties relating to the boundaries of Hudson’s ‘noun’ category demonstrate that there is no uncontroversial way to derive such a superordinate category from POS tagging. Decisions regarding the boundary of the ‘noun’ category have small but statistically significant effects on the ratio that emerges for ‘nouns’ as a whole. Tokenisation and categorisation differences between tagging schemes make it problematic to compare the ratio of ‘nouns’ across different tagsets. The precise figures for POS ratios are therefore effectively artefacts of the tagset. However, these objections to the use of POS ratios do not apply to their use as a metric of variation for comparing datasets tagged with the same tagging scheme.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This hypothesis will be challenged here on empirical grounds from the viewpoint of multiple initial embedding of clauses. The data come from the British National Corpus, Brown, LOB, and philological scholarship. The results extend to several other ‘Standard Average European’ (SAE) languages like Finnish, German, Latin, and Swedish. There is a precise quantitative constraint on the degree of initial clausal embedding, and that limit is two. In double initial embeddings, a qualitative constraint prescribes that typically the highest embedded clause is an if-clause. The lower embedded clause should be the sentential subject of the if-clause. Here is a real example of a maximally complex, prototypical, initial clausal embedding in mainstream SAE: [Main [Init–1 If [Init–2 what is tantamount to dictatorship …] continues in a union] it can …] (LOB).

This paper questions the use of writing-based conceptual frameworks and terminologies in the description of conversational grammar. It is argued that conversation as the major situationally defined variety of the spoken language requires for its adequate description concepts and terminologies that are based on the situational factors that determine the conversational situation. The paper attempts to demonstrate that, conversely, a descriptive apparatus derived from the written code, which by necessity fails to reflect the situational factors governing conversation and implicitly compares features of conversation to the norms of the written language, inevitably conveys negative evaluation of the conversational features observed. This claim will be illustrated by functional and terminological analyses of two conversational key features commonly labelled ‘dislocation’ and ‘dysfluency’. The analyses will be carried out using data from the BNC. Potential alternative concepts and terminologies will be discussed.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This paper defines and describes a new way of categorising word association, the concgram, which constitutes all of the permutations of constituency and positional variation generated by the association of two or more words. Concgrams are identified without prior input from the user (other than to set the size of the span) employing a fully automated search that reveals all of the word association patterns that exist in a corpus. This study argues that concgrams represent more fully word associations in a corpus. Most concgrams seem to be non-contiguous, and show both constituency (AB, ACB) and positional (AB, BA) variations. Further studies of concgrams will help in the task of uncovering the full extent of the idiom principle (Sinclair 1987).",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The findings show that once the overlapping patterns of co-selection of the most frequently occurring lexical words in the SARS corpus have been determined, it is possible to describe the cumulative effects of the habitual co-selection in the lexical items that contribute to textual meanings and coherence within and across the texts. It is argued that patterns of co-selection provide a fuller picture of textual and intertextual coherence than concentrating solely on lexical cohesion.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Based on a corpus of argumentative essays written by Cantonese L1 learners of English, this paper presents a taxonomy of error types and frequency data of the different error types in the use of signalling nouns. The paper then compares the average number of signalling nouns used per essay with grades awarded to the essays, on the one hand, and the numbers of signalling noun errors according to grades, on the other. In both cases there is a significant correlation.

These categories reflect a view on language that treats grammar and lexis along separate lines. Language teaching textbooks on cohesion often follow this division. In contrast, a corpus theoretical approach to the description of English prioritises lexis and does not assume that lexical and grammatical phenomena can be clearly distinguished. Consequently, cohesion can be seen in a new light: cohesion is created by interlocking lexico-grammatical patterns and overlapping lexical items. A corpus theoretical approach to cohesion has important implications for English language teaching. The article looks at difficulties of teaching cohesion, shows links between communicative approaches to ELT and corpus linguistics, and suggests practical applications of corpus theoretical concepts.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Our approach, chiefly corpus-based, uses a machine learning technique, namely Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). The whole acquisition process is divided into three steps: (1) isolating contexts in which specific N-V pairs occur; (2) inferring linguistically-motivated rules that reflect the behaviour of realization N-V pairs; (3) projecting these rules on corpora to find other valid N-V pairs. This technique is evaluated in terms of the relevance of the rules inferred and in terms of the quality (recall and precision) of the results. Results obtained show that our approach is able to find these very specific semantic relationships (the realization N-V pairs) with very good success rates.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Previous corpus-based studies indicate that its overall usage has increased, but there is clearly a gap in research on its semantics. This corpus-driven inductive investigation applies the traditional semantic concepts of root and epistemic meaning to the corpus data. The results suggest that NEED TO covers all the possible meanings/uses, both root and epistemic, of a modal of obligation and necessity. Consequently, it is a possible rival of MUST and HAVE TO in affirmative contexts. However, the traditional analysis leaves out the instances where NEED TO expresses internally motivated compulsion. This is accounted for in recent cross-linguistic studies which rearrange the non-epistemic field. Their insights are taken into consideration, and a synthesis concerning the semantic profile of NEED TO is suggested.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

To account for the functional differences of the two conjunctives, most previous studies focused on different syntactic distributions or semantic contrast by employing an objectivist viewpoint, failing to incorporate the polyfunctionality, semantic overlapping and pragmatic ambiguities of them. This paper advances that the meanings of the two causal suffixes are distributed on four different cognitive-discourse levels: content, epistemic, speech act, and discourse level. Corpus analysis does reveal that all four levels are accessible to both conjunctive suffixes but the difference between the two suffixes lies in the different degree of accessibility of these four levels in their sentence semantics. This finding suggests that we treat these linguistic categories more flexibly by accepting their gradient and pragmatically ambiguous status.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

One was the ability to generate different versions of the chatbot in different languages, bringing chatbot technology to languages with few if any NLP resources: the corpus-based learning techniques transferred straightforwardly to develop chatbots for Afrikaans and Qur'anic Arabic. The second achievement was the ability to learn a very large number of categories within a short time, saving effort and errors in doing such work manually: we generated more than one million AIML categories or conversation-rules from the BNC corpus, 20 times the size of existing AIML rule-sets, and probably the biggest AI Knowledge-Base ever.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

We discuss some potential problems with collecting data from commercial search engine and with using the Web as a corpus. We outline an alternative strategy for data collection, using a personal Web crawler. As a case study, the university Web sites of three nations (Australia, New Zealand and the UK) were crawled. The most frequent words were broadly consistent with non-Web written English, but with some academic-related words amongst the top 50 most frequent. It was also evident that the university Web sites contained a significant amount of non-English text, and academic Web English seems to be more future-oriented than British National Corpus written English.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

However, while other concepts such as collocation, colligation and semantic preference are relatively unproblematic, one cannot say the same for semantic prosody. At present, it is defined in at least three, distinctly different ways, and more significantly, these differences remain largely undiscussed. This article offers a detailed analysis of Louw's concept of semantic prosody (in Sections 1 through 3), and hopes to demonstrate that the concept and the arguments for it are unconvincing. Concluding the article (Sections 4 and 5) is a brief reflection on the paradox created by Louw's use of metaphor in his definition of semantic prosody.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This paper outlines how this approach has been used to create theCorpus del Español, which contains 100 million words of text in Spanish texts from the 1200s-1900s. The main databases are composed of n-grams tables (all unique 1, 2, 3, and 4 word sequences) and the associated frequency of all n-grams in each century (historical Spanish) and register (Modern Spanish). These tables are then joined to other tables containing part of speech, lemma, synonyms, and user-defined lists of words and lemma. There is essentially no limit to the amount of annotation that can be added in additional tables (with little or no impact on performance), and the SQL-based queries allow a wide range of searches that are not available with traditional corpora.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This is an area in which corpus linguistics has a unique contribution to make. With the help of a concordancer, linguistic features that may be overlooked can be made salient and intertextual information that is implicit in a single text can be made explicit. This paper reports on a study of how corpus evidence was used to address questions sent by English language teachers in Hong Kong to a dedicated website. More than one thousand grammar questions sent to the website over a period of eight years were examined. Three types of most frequently asked questions were identified. The paper discusses how corpus evidence was used to help teachers to notice features and patterns which have escaped their attention and to question long-standing assumptions and misconceptions. It shows how subsequent interrogation of corpus data stimulated by teachers' question often led to new insights into linguistic patterns and language use.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The present article explains the original composition briefly and discusses two new inquiries concerning expectations(A-2001andC-2001).Important corrections for future work on the CNC are suggested. The expectations concerning newspapers changed radically during 1996–2001. Within the same period, an obvious rise of interest in fiction can be detected. The reasons for these developments can be traced to trends in Czech society. Thus, we have proposed a considerable reduction in the proportion of newspaper texts and a large increase in the proportion of fiction texts. According to new searches, more detailed percentages for specific subject areas are suggested.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Our suspicion derives from our contrastive analyses of four corpora, two Swedish and two Danish (covering spoken as well as written language), suggesting that – in the dimensions of frequency distribution, word type selection, and distribution over parts of speech – the mode of communication (spoken versus written) is much more significant as a determining factor than even the choice of language (Swedish versus Danish).",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In contrast, this research focuses on the speech of preschool children in naturally-occurring interactions. The discourse functions of antonymy in child-produced and child-directed language are quantified and compared with those identified in adult, written English (Jones 2002). Despite its complexity, Ancillary Antonymy is found to be most common in child-produced speech, even from the age of two, perhaps because of its particular usefulness in structuring ideas and discourse. This study presents a detailed inter-corpus comparison, assesses the discourse functions of antonymy at different stages of childhood, and discusses the correlation between antonym use in child-directed and child-produced speech.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

An analysis of the information status of the extraposed subject shows that it is possible to distinguish two basic types (Given Complement Extraposition and New Complement Extraposition) which differ fundamentally in their communicative potential and distribution in different (spoken and written) text types.

First, collocations regarding fire incident processing are dealt with in both languages. Then the lexical units larger than collocations are explored, followed by a discussion on textual cohesion created by collocation and variable lexical units. A script model for the Chinese fire news texts is then proposed, to illustrate the concept of “text contour” in certain types of discourse. Finally, the implication of this fixedness and its variability across languages is discussed in terms of the problems it poses for language learners and translators.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

It is viewed as a means to supplement multi-word term (MWT) extraction, the focus of which is on noun phrases. However, little is known about the value of this technique in a terminological setting. This paper examines two different methods for finding French SWTs in the field of computing. The first one (M1) compares the specialized corpus to a corpus considered to be a reflection of language as a whole. The second one (M2) breaks down the specialized corpus into six topical subcorpora that are compared in turn to the entire specialized corpus. The calculation relies on standard normal distribution and is carried out by a program calledTermoStat. The specific units produced by both methods are then evaluated by comparing them to the contents of two specialized dictionaries. We also compare the results yielded by the two methods. Results show that precision is fair (approximately 50%of units extracted by both methods can be found in specialized dictionaries). However, recall is lower in both methods. Results also reveal that, even though M1 yields better results that M2, both methods are useful for identifying SWTs and should be considered in terminological work.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

However, CDA is not without its critics. Constructive criticism has been offered by Stubbs, who suggests bolstering CDA by using a large corpus as the basis on which to make reliable generalisations about language use. Taking up that suggestion, this paper reports on a study of a group of words semantically related to corruption. In the study, corpus methodology is used to manipulate the data: concordances and collocational tools are used to provide semantic profiles of the words and highlight connotational differences, and to identify the geographical locations that the words refer to. It is argued that words with a noticeably negative connotation tend to be used when referring to activities that take place outside of Britain, while less negative words are used when referring to similar activities in British contexts. CDA theory is drawn on to interpret the ideological significance of the findings.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Specifically, it focuses on the use of the rise and rise-fall tones by speakers to assert dominance and control in different discourse types. Brazil (1997) argues that the use of the rise and the rise-fall tones is a means of exerting dominance and control at certain points in the discourse and that while conversational participants have the option to freely exchange this role throughout the discourse, in other kinds of discourse such behaviour would be seen to be usurping the role of the designated dominant speaker. The findings suggest that the choice of certain tones is determined by both the discourse type and the designated roles of the speakers, but is not confined to the native speakers or determined by gender.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Many of these are evident in any type of research which attempts to compare authentic data of any kind, but the difficulties are accentuated by the availability of vast amounts of data in this case. In particular, questions relating to how one selects the features to be compared and, more importantly, how the findings may be interpreted, invite us to elaborate our methodology far more explicitly than in other types of research. The accessibility of the same body of data to other researchers also means that (a) the findings can be assessed and challenged in other studies, and (b) other researchers can invoke different, and perhaps more plausible explanations of the same findings by appealing to parameters that may have been downplayed or ignored in previous studies. These issues have been extensively debated in the literature on corpus linguistics, but rarely – if ever – in the context of corpus-based translation studies. A small-scale study involving comparisons between corpora of translated and non-translated texts in English in terms of frequency and distribution of recurring lexical patterns is used to examine some methodological issues in corpus-based translation research and suggest different ways in which the same findings may be interpreted depending on the variables on which individual researchers choose to focus.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

By forming, permutating and counting subsets of the verb's neighboring set of phrases, and by applying the statistical filters mentioned previously, valid syntactic frames of verbs are detected.

The method, referred to as `distinctive-collexeme analysis', identifies lexemes that exhibit a strong preference for one member of the pair as opposed to the other, and thus makes it possible to identify subtle distributional differences between the members of such a pair. The method can be applied in the context of what is sometimes referred to as `grammatical alternation' (e.g. the dative alternation), but it can also be applied to other choices provided by the grammar (such as the two future tense constructions in English). The method has two main applications. First, it can reveal subtle differences between seemingly synonymous constructions, many of which are difficult to identify on the basis of more traditional approaches. Second, it can be used to investigate the very notion of `alternation'; we show that many alternations are much more restricted than has hitherto been assumed, and thus confirm the claims of recent, non-derivational views of grammar.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The method is framed in a construction-based approach to language, i.e. it assumes that grammar consists of signs (form-meaning pairs) and is thus not fundamentally different from the lexicon. The method is applied to linguistic expressions at various levels of abstraction (words, semi-fixed phrases, argument structures, tense, aspect and mood). The method has two main applications: first, to increase the adequacy of grammatical description by providing an objective way of identifying the meaning of a grammatical construction and determining the degree to which particular slots in it prefer or are restricted to a particular set of lexemes; second, to provide data for linguistic theory-building.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In particular, the analysis aims to overcome shortfalls of previous analyses by, firstly, adopting a multifactorial approach integrating all variables postulated in the literature, thereby doing justice to the well-established fact that cognitive and psychological processes are multivariate and complex. Secondly, the phenomenon is investigated on the basis of a large corpus, rendering the results obtained more representative and valid of naturally occurring language than those of previous studies. To this end, corpus-linguistic operationalizations of phonological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic determinants of AO are devised and entered into a Linear Discriminant Analysis, which determines the relative influence of all variables (semantic variables being most important) and yields a classification accuracy of 78%. Moreover, by means of the operationalizations developed in this analysis, the ordering of yet unanalyzed adjective strings can be predicted with about equal accuracy (73.5%).",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

When used like this, the MN is generally considered to constitute the lexical head of the bi-nominal noun phrase. However, the notion of ‘MN' can be extended to include such expressions as a bunch of and heaps of, which, strictly speaking, do not designate a ‘measure', but display a more nebulous potential for quantification.The structural status of MNs in this broader sense then is far from straightforward and most grammatical reference works of English are either hesitant or silent with regard to the issue. Two main analytical options seem to suggest themselves. Either the MN is interpreted as constituting the head of the NP, with the of-phrase as a qualifier to this head, or the MN is analysed as a modifier, more specifically a quantifier, to the head, which in this case is the noun in the of-phrase.Starting from the structural analyses of MN-constructions offered by such linguists as Halliday and Langacker, my paper goes on to discuss a corpus study aimed at charting and elucidating the structural ambivalence observed in MN-constructions. The framework eventually opted for is that of ‘grammaticalization', since it provides the most comprehensive account for the developments displayed by MN-constructions, in that it brings to the fore the very intricate interplay between the lexical and the grammatical status of the MN. In addition, it also does justice to the diachronic dimension implied in the mechanisms of delexicalization and grammaticalization.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Using bi-text for bilingual lexicons extraction,2003,"Textual aligning consists in pairing segments (e.g. sentences or phrases) that are translational equivalents across corpora of translations. An interesting application of textual aligning is the automatic extraction of bilingual lexicons. As it has been pointed out during previous evaluation campaigns, such as Arcade, lexical aligning remains problematic. In order to solve problems of consistency linked with the concept of translational compositionality, a redefinition of lexical aligning task is proposed, introducing the concept of lexical correspondence. Simple techniques dedicated to lexical correspondences extraction are then evaluated. Thus, it appears that adapted statistical filters allow to extract very accurately significant regularities that are relevant at the contrastive level. More generally, these methods prove to be adapted not only for bilingual lexicons extraction: they could be used to study a wide range of contrastive phenomena on empirical basis.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Second, it investigates whether Church et al.'s (1994) sub-test can be fruitfully applied to this phenomenon. As to the first issue, I conclude that individual -ic/-ical adjectives can be located on a continuum of semantic similarity, with some being virtually completely synonymous and others being strongly differentiated; several semantic and distributional distinctions between members of adjective pairs are pointed out on the basis of distinctive collocates. As to the second question, I demonstrate on the basis of a simulation that the sub-test is conceptually adequate, but suffers from its asymptotic approach, which is why Fisher-exact is argued to be a more adequate diagnostic.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Based on extensive corpus data, Tao (2001) investigates the use of remember in spoken English and proposes that complement-taking is actually a marginal feature of remember, and remember can be seen as undergoing changes toward becoming a discourse particle in spoken English. This paper extends the previous study by bringing in forget for comparison against remember. It is shown that while both remember and forget disprefer complements, forget lacks the placement flexibility seen in remember but allows more tense options; at the same time, forget also has its own pragmatically strengthened patterns in such combinations as ‘forget it’ and ‘don't forget to.’ Overall this study shows that not only can usage-based investigations provide a realistic account of argument structure, a usage-based approach is also instrumental in elucidating the varied local patterns that are often confined to individual linguistic entities or sequences in highly specified contexts, a conclusion which supports the emergent view of argument structure.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The comparison of tag frequencies is an essential complement to work on recent linguistic change carried out on the untagged material, because this work has been based on the – so far unverified – assumption that tag frequencies have remained constant over the thirty-year period in question. In addition, the paper discusses some common and partly contradictory claims about the prevalence of a “nominal” style in present-day written English. It is shown that while part-of-speech frequencies have not remained constant over the period investigated, the shifts are usually not big enough to invalidate the results obtained in analyses of the untagged material. With regard to style, the material shows a significant rise in the frequency of nouns, which, however, is not paralleled by a corresponding decrease in verbs.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In order to overcome subjectivity in specialised corpora, a corpus-directed system of internal selection using lexical criteria is proposed. The aim is not to create rigid boundaries but to see clearly what is actually present in the corpus. The method adopted is demonstrated on a corpus consisting of research articles from specialised journals and conference proceedings in the field of plant biology. Restricted collocational networks are used to isolate prototypical groupings within the corpus. It is shown that audience is an important factor in strong and weak prototypical groupings in theme and domain specific corpora.

The above model, applied to all (16) translations of Plato’s Republic from the TELRI CD ROM, produced the following language order (average coding length in bits per character): Slovenian (2,37), Serbocroatian (3,77), Croatian (3,84), Bulgarian (3,96), Czech (4,10), Polish (4,32), Russian (4,46), Slovak (4,46), Latvian (4,74), Lithuanian (4,94), English (5,40), French (5,67), German (5,69), Romanian (5,76), Finnish (6,11), and Hungarian (6,47).",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

They are based on the monolingual Cobuild learners’ dictionaries, and they are partly translated—they contain translated definitions and translation equivalents. This paper shows the possible ways of exploiting Bridge dictionaries for creating new bilingual or multilingual dictionaries.
One possible way is to extract corresponding translation equivalents, edit them, and make a new printed dictionary. As both sides of such a dictionary were originally created as translations from English, the dictionary requires quite a lot of lexicographic work.
Another possibility is to create an electronic version of the dictionary “as is”. For this purpose, it is necessary to convert the dictionary first into SGML format and define its DTD. This format can then serve as a standard for future Bridge dictionaries and adding new language modules to existing dictionaries would be quite easy.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The main corpus, which will comprise about 90% of the entire collection, will be sampled statistically. For analytical purposes it will use a conceptual tool in the form of a multidimensional matrix combining demographic and contextual tiers. The combined demographic and contextual design will be capable of showing the distribution of speech types in various subgroups of the population. The supplementary corpus will include about 10% of the collected data, and will add to the statistically-sampled corpus some targeted demographically sampled texts and a contextually designed collection. This design is culturally dependent to suit the special structure of the Israeli Hebrew speech community and thus includes both native and non-native speakers of Hebrew. Nonetheless, the principles governing this design are such that they would service study of many other speech communities, to the extent that the design itself may be employed for other corpora with only slight modifications.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

In concrete, I analyze the use of Korean reflexives ‘caki’, ‘casin’, and ‘cakicasin’ by examining the occurrences of these reflexives in a 5-million-word Korean corpus, taken from a 10-million-word Korean corpus which is called “KOREA-1 Corpus”, compiled at Korea University (H. Kim and B. Kang 1996). This corpus is composed of various genres of Korean texts including 10% of spoken material. From the KWIC concordances of accusative forms of these reflexives, ‘cakilul, casin-ul, cakicasin-ul’, I examined whether a reflexive has a local antecedent or a long-distance antecedent. The result is that ‘caki’ is almost even in having local and long-distance antecedents, but ‘casin’ has more and ‘cakicasin’ has much more local antecedents. I also examined the thematic roles of the local antecedents of reflexives, which shows that ‘casin’ has relatively more Experiencer antecedents than ‘caki’ has, although in both cases Agent antecedents dominate. The outcome of this frequency analysis suggests that a tendency (probably not yet grammaticalized), or degree of “naturalness” is real and can be captured in the usage data provided that we have a sizable amount of material which can be handled in an efficient way as provided by the corpus linguistic method of the present day. At the least, the result of such an investigation can provide a solid base from which further theorizing may proceed.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

It studies the distribution patterns of a small set of lexical items that are derived from Aboriginal languages or relate to Aboriginal concerns.

Extracting by automatic means the translation equivalents deemed accurate and contextually appropriate by a human translator is of great practical importance for various fields such as example-based machine translation, computational lexicography, information retrieval, etc. The task of word or phrase level identification is greatly reduced if suitable anchor points can be found in the stream of texts. It is suggested that grammatical morphemes provide very useful clues to finding translation equivalents. They typically form a closed set, occur frequently enough in sentences, have more or less fixed meanings, and, most important, will stand in a one-to-one or at most one-to-few relationship with corresponding elements in the other language. This paper will explore the viability of the idea with reference to the Hungarian and English versions of Plato’s Republic, which are available in sentence-aligned form. Hungarian has a rich set of suffixes which are typically deployed in a concatenated manner. Corresponding to them in English are prepositions, auxiliary words, and suffixes. The paper will show how, by starting from a well defined set of correspondences between Hungarian grammatical morphemes and their equivalents and using a combination of pattern matching and heuristics, one can arrive at a mapping of phrases between the two texts.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The present paper defines an alternative metric, which measures the accuracy with which successive words are fitted into parsetrees. (The original statement of this metric is believed to have been the earliest published proposal about quantifying parse accuracy.) The metric defined here gives overall scores that quantify intuitive concepts of good and bad parsing relatively directly, and it gives scores for individual words which enable the location of parsing errors to be pinpointed. It applies to a wider range of grammar formalisms, and is tunable for specific parsing applications.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

While the nature of data may differ in various fields of linguistic research (e.g., bilingual vs. monolingual corpora), perspectives on the analysis of such material have not been different, and they have traditionally been analysed as singly-occurring items out of context. However, corpus research has shown that words rarely occur in isolation. On the basis of a number of English loans in a corpus of Turkish compiled in a multilingual setting, and a number of Italian loans in a corpus of English compiled in a monolingual setting, we conclude that collocational patterns growing around loanwords are significant and should be included in the treatment of loanwords.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The proposal is based on robust, knowledge-poor pronoun resolution followed by post-editing.The paper is structured as follows. The introduction comments on the fact that automatic identification of referential links in corpora has lagged behind in comparison with similar lexical, syntactical, and even semantic tasks. The second section of the paper outlines the author s robust, knowledge-based approach to pronoun resolution which will subsequently be put forward as the core of a larger architecture proposed for the automatic tagging of referential links. Section 3 briefly presents other related knowledge-poor approaches, while Section 4 discusses the limitations and advantages of the knowledge-poor approach outlined in Section 2. The main argument of the paper is to be found in Section 5, which presents the idea of developing a semi-automatic environment for annotating anaphoric links and outlines the components of such a program. Finally, the conclusion looks at the anticipated success rate of the approach.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The aim of this paper is basically descriptive: (i) some information is given on the linguistic information stored; (ii) some tentative conclusions are drawn. For example, if the COBUILD formality labels were assigned rigorously, it might be concluded that (i) ""formality"" is a skew system; (ii) that the ""formal/informal"" scale has an equi distribution; (iii) that emphasising informal adverbs are so numerous because they illustrate a tendency to exaggeration observed in informal, relaxed situations, in which interactants usually struggle for controlling the message.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

These hypotheses are then tested on the corpus data. I argue that a sound descriptive study should not end with simply stating the results from the corpus study. Instead, the corpus data have to be supplemented. An appropriate way to supplement corpus data is through the use of elicitation techniques.

In the first place, some corpora and databases are compiled in such a way as to be searched and analysed by means of tools which allow only specific kinds of search to be made. This often prevents scholars from carrying out their own free study of the data, thus hindering an effective, targeted analysis. Moreover, in some cases, the need for comprehensiveness leads to the codification and classification of subjective aspects like the text difficulty and the participants' social level This subjectivity of interpretation might mislead the researchers in a socially-orientated analysis. Finally, despite being highly sophisticated, the techniques employed for automated grammatical and part-of-speech tagging as well as for semantic and prosodic parsing appear not to be totally reliable, since mistakes in the codification of simple items are likely to occur. Each of the above thorny issues, together with some other minor matters, are testified to with instances drawn from the author's personal linguistic research on a variety of synchronic and diachronic corpora and databases.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Formulae, or formulaic expressions, are multi-word units performing a pragmatic and/or discourse-structuring function and have been characterised as being typically native-like. The methodology presented here is contrastive and involves the use of computerised corpora of both native and non-native speaker speech. It consists of two steps: (1) the automatic extraction of all recurrent word combinations to produce lists of potential formulae, and (2) a carefully specified manual filtering process designed to reduce these lists to lists of actual formulaic usage. The results of this process allow for the first genuine quantitative comparison of formulae in the speech of native and non-native speakers, which in turn has significant implications for SLA research.

Hengeveld 1989; Van Valin Jr. 1993).

It is further posited that the conceptual frameworks of scientific sublanguages can be visualised through closed set collocational networks.

Automatic matching of corpus translation with dictionary senses depends on the quality of the lexicographic knowledge used, the quality of corpus processing, the impact of statistics to filter relevant entries from the corpora, and finally the quality of the translations in the multilingual corpora. We focus on the influence that the latter variable has on the performance of the automatic matching. Similarly to previous approaches, we relied on Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRDs), a part-of-speech tagger, and bilingual aligned corpora. Additionally, we used a shallow sentence parser for syntactic matching. Two case studies with two different corpora from different domains were conducted. Our test set was the intersection of 500 French communication verbs within the corpora. The results confirm that the performance of the automatic matching varies considerably with the translation quality of the parallel texts.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

We identify and classify the transitive uses of sixteen representative verbs of sound found in the corpus data.

In the aspectual dimension, we exploit the classification of adverbs which modify verbs in a corpus. By combining the results of two classifications, we obtain an elaborate classification of verbs. We can incorporate the prototypicality of the members which constitute each semantic subclass by taking account of the frequency of case particles patterns and cooccurring adverbs. Moreover, the existence of close relationships among them enable us to detect the organization of these subclasses.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

We conclude with an evaluation of the relative utility of a large array of different metrics and processing techniques in relation to our defined performance criteria.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Leech; Mary Hodges,Social Differentiation in the Use of English Vocabulary: Some Analyses of the Conversational Component of the British National Corpus,1997,"In this article, we undertake selective quantitative analyses of the demographi-cally-sampled spoken English component of the British National Corpus (for brevity, referred to here as the ''Conversational Corpus""). This is a subcorpus of c. 4.5 million words, in which speakers and respondents (see I below) are identified by such factors as gender, age, social group, and geographical region. Using a corpus analysis tool developed at Lancaster, we undertake a comparison of the vocabulary of speakers, highlighting those differences which are marked by a very high X2 value of difference between different sectors of the corpus according to gender, age, and social group. A fourth variable, that of geographical region of the United Kingdom, is not investigated in this article, although it remains a promising subject for future research. (As background we also briefly examine differences between spoken and written material in the British National Corpus [BNC].) This study is illustrative of the potentiality of the Conversational Corpus for future corpus-based research on social differentiation in the use of language. There are evident limitations, including (a) the reliance on vocabulary frequency lists and (b) the simplicity of the transcription system employed for the spoken part of the BNC The conclusion of the article considers future advances in the research paradigm illustrated here.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Corpus-based techniques are particularly well suited to these research purposes, enabling investigation of research questions that were previously disregarded. Specifically, the paper discusses the use of corpus-based techniques to identify and analyze complex ""association patterns"": the systematic ways in which linguistic features are used in association with other linguistic and non-linguistic features. Several illustrative analyses are discussed, investigating the use of lexical features, grammatical features, and the overall patterns of variability among texts and registers.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The study involved a series of computer searches, using the CD-ROM version of the Oxford English Dictionary (1989). Our aim was to discover how many and at what point in time words were borrowed into English from Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. The paper describes the general obstacles and limitations — both with the Oxford English Dictionary and the computer searches — that circumscribe our results. We then present our findings, relating them to extant research.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Section I outlines the development of epistemic disjuncts in the history of English, concentrating on the kinds of comment they could lexicalise.. Briefly, OE epistemic adverbs only encoded the speaker's comment on the high probability or importance of the proposition they related to. ME allowed a new type of comment, namely on the low probability of the adjoined proposition. In the second section, the data drawn from the computarised Helsinki Corpus suggest that though Early Modern English is a transitional period in epistemic disjunct development, it shows greater semantic diversification than OE and ME. Syntactic and distributional features are considered in every case. Finally, sociolinguistic variables and the registers and text types which favour the occurrence of these adverbs are also specified.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

This paper argues that the importance of domain knowledge in terminography makes the terminographer a significantly different kind of corpus user than the lexicographer. We begin by identifying the role of a corpus in terminography. Next, we propose ways of designing and balancing corpora so that they are consistent with these roles. Finally, we outline a number of terminography-specific functionalities that would be useful in a terminographer's workbench. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of corpus terminography for terminographical methods, for the design of terminological dictionaries, and for corpus shareability.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

The examination of reflexives in English in several corpora reveals a variety of patterns, which are analysed within a schema-based approach to grammar (Barlow and Kemmer 1994). This approach follows the cognitive/functional tradition of grammatical analysis in viewing all grammatical units as composed of form-meaning pairings.The paper demonstrates that a schema-based approach is well-suited to the task of describing the major and minor patterns of use revealed by corpus analysis. The importance of text analysis in language teaching is highlighted and connections between the schema-based grammatical formalism and data-driven approaches to second language learning (Johns 1991b) are briefly explored.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics

Accurate description of those patterns requires a level of analytic delicacy which was not possible until the advent of large bodies of data, along with techniques for distinguishing significant patterns from mere noise. Such analysis is in its infancy, but it is already clear that, in order to analyse the semantics of verbs empirically, it is necessary to identify typical subjects, objects, and adverbials and to group individual lexical items into sets within those clause roles. The nature of lexical sets is discussed and an attempt is made to indicate the range of semantic and syntactic phenomena likely to be encountered in lexical analysis of this kind.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics
https://doi.org/10.1075/ijcl.1.1.07sin,John McH. Sinclair,The Empty Lexicon,1996,"This paper1 contrasts two views on the analysis of language. In one view, language is primarily seen as a carrier of messages in sentences whose propo-sitional content can be retrieved, and symbolised in a knowledge base. In the other, language is seen as a means of communication that deals in much more complex matters than just carrying messages.In relation to vocabulary and the design of lexicons, the model of terminology suits the first position, while in the other the lexicon is considered empty at the start and is gradually filled with the evidence of usage.Similar contrasts are made in other areas relevant to natural language processing. In one approach, the expectation is of tidiness and conformity to rules; the other stresses the inherently provisional nature of the organisation of language and, therefore, the meanings.As these two approaches encounter the vast amount of evidence stored in today's corpora, their methods and responses contrast in interesting ways.",International Journal of Corpus Linguistics
