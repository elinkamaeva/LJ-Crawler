Hypothesis 1 proposes 30 segments: four monophthongs, one diphthong and 25 consonants. Hypothesis 2 proposes 54 segments: two monophthongs and 52 consonants. Hypothesis 3 proposes 55 segments: three monophthongs and 52 consonants. The choice between these three hypotheses has significant implications for models of phonological contrast, phonotactic organization, syllable structure and partial reduplication processes in Kaytetye. We evaluate the three hypotheses against evidence from these domains and find that Hypothesis 1 is the best supported phonological analysis. Companion analysis of the phonetic distribution and functional load of medial Kaytetye monophthong tokens was conducted by phonetically-trained transcribers, and compared with groupings of vowels obtained through unsupervised classification of first and second formant values using finite Gaussian mixture models. Both transcriber-perceived and machine-learnt categorizations agree that none of the four monophthongs are marginal, nor can their qualities be attributed to phonological context effects. These data demonstrate the importance of both phonological and phonetic evidence in evaluating the structure and properties of vowel systems in under-described languages.

It is unknown, however, if individual differences in personality traits can influence pointing preferences within a single culture. Here, we sought to examine how extraversion is associated with people’s manual and non-manual pointing preferences. In a referential communication task, speakers were required to describe locations and objects on a complex display for addressees. The results showed that participants with high extraversion used more manual pointing than those with low extraversion. However, the two groups showed no difference in the mean number of non-manual pointing. It may be that compared with less extraverted speakers, highly extraverted speakers have more energy that can be devoted into interpersonal communication. These findings provide the first step to understanding that personality traits can act as an important moderator in pointing preferences and, more broadly, about the nature and emergence of human communication.

The paper has a twofold aim: (i) to highlight the polysemous nature of English stage-of-life words and make a clear distinction between their reference and address meanings; and (ii) to show that the address meanings of stage-of-life words reflect their sociopragmatic function in discourse. Using Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) methodology, separate semantic explications are produced for the meanings expressed by each address noun in different interactional contexts. More generally, the present study highlights the interface between semantics, pragmatics and cultural assumptions, showing how this connection can be used as the starting point to conduct a proper ethnography of speaking.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

This article compiles a typology by researching tonogenesis from 40 different languages across a range of families. Each tonogenetic event within these languages is coded for syntagmatic position, manner and laryngeal setting of the tonogenetic trigger. I further make a distinction between ‘strict’ tonogenesis, when a language acquires tone for the first time, as something distinct from ‘broad’ tonogenesis, in which a tonal language develops additional tones. The results of this typology then reveal several novel findings, including the prevalence of onset-conditioned tonogenesis and the importance of sonority in strict tonogenesis. In summary, I show that the Vietnamese model is not applicable in most cases and that tonogenesis is a highly varied phenomenon, warranting further detailed study and a more refined model.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Against this backdrop Three Minute Thesis (3MT) presentations have emerged, although we have not yet developed sufficient knowledge about how students present their research work to diverse audiences. In this study, we compared 80 students’ hyping practice of using promotional language to embellish or exaggerate aspects of the same research in 3MT presentations and thesis abstracts to explore how they understand their disciplinary knowledge and its connection with different audiences, and how they adapt their discourse accordingly. Our findings show that students hyped more frequently in 3MT presentations, relying on adverbial affective markers and attending to the broad research area. In thesis abstracts, conversely, boosting hypes were mainly used, especially verb resources, to comment on certainty of knowledge claims and promote the research methods used in the doctoral research. We see the divergency as a likely consequence of different communicative purposes between the two genres, and the different academic status and power asymmetry between students and the audience of each genre. In addition, disciplinarity was noted. Students in the hard sciences made more use of hypes in their 3MT presentations than their peers in the soft sciences and were inclined to promote both broad and specific research areas and embellish the primacy attached to their research. This disciplinary hyping practice is perhaps related to the conceptual abstractness of scientific knowledge and its opaque connection with common wisdom and public interest. Therefore, this study reveals not only that hypes mark a speaker’s orientation to what and who is addressed, but also that students modulate academic persuasion to balance their promotion of results and claims against the discoursal expectations and knowledge bases of different audiences.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

This paper seeks to demystify this connection between the past and the future by investigating how these past forms contribute to the expression of futurity and setting this within an overall analysis of the future constructions in this language. Based on the form of the main verb in 940 sentences with verbal future constructions, six constructions were identified and categorized into future-oriented past constructions (FPST), which include the Past Simple and the Future Simple, and future-oriented present constructions (FPRT), which include the Present Simple, the Present Progressive, the Present Subjunctive and the WANT construction. A construction grammar approach together with Reichenbach and neo-Reichenbach terminology was then utilized to distinguish the differing relations between tense, aspect, mood and speaker perspective, and assign syntactic-semantic maps in terms of features such as level of formality, perfectness, intended future, certainty and inner aspect (aktionsart) to each of the FPST and FPRT constructions. It is argued that the use of the past form of the main verb in the Past Simple and the Future Simple (FPST constructions) owes much to aspectual and ontological factors, with the past element indicating certainty, perfectness and a speaker perspective of looking back.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

We consider some dimensions of these multimodal practices, including kinship signs and signs for time-reference, and discuss several notable features in these domains. The first is gender-motivated use of the left and right sides of the body in several kinship signs. The second is the use of celestial anchoring in some signs for time. The use of spatially accurate pointing also contributes to the indexical richness of these communicative practices, as do some introduced semiotic resources, such as air-writing, and Auslan fingerspelling. As the first description of Gurindji sign, we establish a basis for further understandings of how tradition and innovation are incorporated into these shared practices.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Now, due to climate change, events such as wildfires, floods and heatwaves are becoming more severe and more frequent. Therefore, the climate crisis poses a challenge, not only materially, but discursively. Habitual vocabulary may no longer be appropriate, and there is a pull between these turns of phrase and newer ones informed by climate change. The article takes the case of Australia whose public discourse in English about ‘bushfires’ has been characterized by traditional vocabulary, focused on battling the elements. Through three examples, the study treats tensions between the habitual and the climate-informed in event names (e.g. Black Summer), a social category (volunteer firefighters) and a construction of political critique (I don’t hold a hose). The frame taken is semantically-enhanced discourse studies, inspired by natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) and other cultural takes. A transtextual approach is used, along with research from humanities and social science. The study finds that through the interplay between habitual and climate-informed vocabulary about ‘bushfires’, one can view conceptions of events, cultures, social relations, identities and relationships to places in Australia. Extreme weather formations and climate change formations cannot be easily separated.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

While both should be indispensable to the exploration of each other, the relationship between them has seldom been touched upon. This study takes the Chinese negative marker mei (you) as a case study by investigating its evolutionary path in relation to spatial cognition. Drawing on corpus-based data across three historical stages before Modern Chinese, the study yields the following findings. First, the original meaning of mei involves dynamic spatial movement, which can extend to abstract domains. Second, rich concrete meanings of mei trigger semantic schematization at the second stage, spatial cognition playing a fundamental role. Third, the negative marker use of mei combines with you at the third stage, which is attributed to the fact that the spatial existence of you fits with the semantic component of existence in mei. The significance of the study lies in three aspects: first, the division of historical stages accords with the key turning points in the evolution of Chinese; second, the exploration follows a diachronic development, instead of being based merely on static performance; and third, this perspective sheds light on the role of spatial cognition in the conceptualization of negation in both Chinese and other languages.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

This paper proposes various etymologies and supports the Barngarla language reclamation. Reflecting Barngarla epistemology and traditional ecological knowledge, toponyms are intimately connected to place name reclamation and language reclamation. Delineating hunting, foraging and fishing places, geographical features, and sites embedded in oral history, toponyms also provide windows into broader diachronic processes within grammar and phonology. Oral history recorded by the German missionary Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann indicates naming practices dating back to the late-Pleistocene showing some similarities to other, non-Barngarla groups. Several named band areas seem focused on floristic regions. Barngarla toponyms exhibit signs of diachronic processes both regarding phonology and grammar. We explore the extent to which post-invasion Barngarla names are identifiable, propose evidence for Thura-Yura lenition of an original gabi ‘water’ form, and discuss a locative form -la unrecorded by Schürmann.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Within the Umpila and Kuuku Ya’u speech community there is a strong cultural preference for multiparty storytelling – a preference which has been noted in a number of Aboriginal Australian contexts. This paper seeks to understand the mechanisms through which co-tellers in these multiparty narratives contribute to the story. It first discusses co-teller roles, and distinguishes three key narrator roles and orders of conduct associated with each. The analysis then focuses on the use of questions and evaluative comments used by one type of co-teller, supporting narrators. The following discussion demonstrates that questions and evaluative comments go beyond immediate functions of seeking information or spontaneous expressive reactions. They help to fulfil expectations on supporting narrators to engage actively in the talk. It is additionally shown that these devices have functions in highlighting key aspects of the story and developing stance in intricate ways that complement the main line of the storytelling. The analysis demonstrates the close coordination of co-tellers in constructing a story; piece-by-piece they collaboratively describe and evaluate the story events as a group, prioritizing a local and situated shared telling over other potential story goals like performance and progressivity of a plot. The analysis of Umpila and Kuuku Ya’u storytelling contributes to the field of interaction and narrative studies by furthering our understanding of the organization of storytelling in different cultures and languages contexts.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

The distribution of nominalizers in Lhasa Tibetan demonstrates a regular pattern. Some nominalizers are bi-functional in that they can mark both participant and event nominalizations while others are uni-functional in that they can only mark participant nominalizations. It is found that the difference between the two types of nominalizers correlates to whether the nominalizer (NML) is argument-associated or adjunct-associated. An account of the correlation is developed in the theoretical framework of generative grammar. It is argued that the syntactic derivation of an NML-phrase gives rise to a binding relationship between the nominalizer and the suppressed element in the source constituent Aspect Phrase (AspP) or the AspP itself, leading to a condition on its semantic interpretation. The condition is satisfied in a participant NML-phrase headed by a nominalizer of either type and in an event NML-phrase headed by a bi-functional nominalizer. It is not in an event NML-phrase headed by a uni-functional nominalizer for the reason that in the calculation of event semantics arguments align with events while adjuncts align with predicates. Specifically, a bi-functional nominalizer, being argument-associated, semantically matches both a suppressed argument in a participant NML-phrase and the source constituent AspP, whereas a uni-functional one, being adjunct-associated, semantically matches a suppressed adjunct in a participant NML-phrase but not the source constituent AspP. Consequently, no event NML-phrase headed by an adjunct-associated nominalizer is found in this language. The findings of this study have implications for both analyzing the distribution of nominalizers in other Tibeto-Burman languages and the syntactic and semantic mechanisms that constrain them, and for classifying the argument/adjunct asymmetry, which is fundamental in most current linguistic frameworks as well as research on human sentence processing.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Diachronic studies of quotation in Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand English have all documented the same trends: a relatively stable system, using a small number of quotative variants, becomes more varied and complex, with a decline in the frequency of canonical say correlating with an increasing tendency to quote thought. This study, modelled on two foregoing sociolinguistic analyses of mainstream West Australian and New Zealand Englishes, examines quotation in recordings of 26 speakers of Australian Aboriginal English born between 1907 and 1961, including 16 oral histories. The results indicate that, unlike their settler English-speaking counterparts, these speakers have not only preserved the dominance of say: they have come to use it in distinctive ways, with semantic and grammatical innovations not observed in other varieties, in a system which serves to enrich narrative in a speaker population unique for its millennia of oral tradition. The findings suggest processes of grammaticalization and, observed alongside similar expanding frequency and versatility of be like in mainstream Englishes, may signal a parallel evolutive effect in a different language ecology.

The serial comma (also known as the Oxford comma or Harvard comma) refers to the existence of a pause immediately before the conjunctions and/or (and sometimes nor) in a series of three or more elements in a clause. Although the use of this mark of punctuation is no longer a desideratum in Present-day British English, it was a disseminated practice among seventeenth-, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers. In light of this, this work has been conceived with the following objectives: (a) to study the use and distribution of the serial comma in the period 1500–1999; (b) to evaluate its distribution in the two types of writing, i.e. handwriting and printing, and the level of variation across text types; and (c) to ascertain whether the number of elements in the series participates in its deployment. The source of evidence comes from The Málaga Corpus of Early English Scientific Prose (MCEESP), the corpus of Early English Medical Writing (CEEM) and A Representative Corpus of Historical English Registers (ARCHER 3.2).",Australian Journal of Linguistics

I demonstrate that wan is undergoing a process of grammaticalization from being a lexical item to a functional one. I also argue that because of this process, wan is found in different places in syntax. As a main predicate, it is projected in the head of the VP; in contrast, while functioning as a telic morpheme, it is in the head of the Inner Aspect Phrase between the vP and VP. This study sheds light on the Chinese aspectual system and suggests that Chinese uses at least two different mechanisms to mark telicity: resultative complements and overt telic morphemes.

The present study puts the implications of this claim and others found in the literature to the empirical test through an examination of all of the 2,621 occurrences of the Present Perfect in since-clauses with pronominal subjects in the British National Corpus and the Corpus of Contemporary American English. A significant proportion of the data is shown to contradict the generalizations proposed in previous studies. An explanation capable of accounting for all of the uses of the Present Perfect in since-clauses is put forward based on the complex meaning of this verbal structure which involves the notion of present stative after-phase of a past situation. The Present Perfect is possible in a since-clause whenever the beginning of the after-phase serves to mark the beginning-point in the past from which the main-clause situation unfolds towards the present. The beginning of the after-phase is argued to be interpretable in two ways: either as the first moment after the end of the prior situation or as the first moment in the process of accruing the after-phase itself.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

However, few studies to our knowledge have specifically discussed a hypothetical source construction of separate clauses and a hypothetical initial-to-medial pathway. Chinese guoran was first used as a separate clause, and later developed into an epistemic adverbial meaning ‘it really happens’. Diachronic investigations reveal that it followed a hypothetical initial-to-medial pathway leading from a clause-initial position to a clause-medial position. The hypothetical source construction and the hypothetical pathway are supported by diachronic changes of other epistemic adverbials in Chinese, and may be adopted to account for the formation of some epistemic adverbials in the other languages.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

In Italian, there are two synonymous Italian words for ‘here’, namely qui and qua, and two synonymous words for ‘there’, lì and là. Qui ‘here’ and là ‘there’ are iconic because qui has the high front vowel /i/ and là has the low vowel /a/, whereas qua ‘here’ and lì ‘there’ are counter-iconic, since their vowels are the opposite. Based on corpus, survey and computational data, we demonstrate that (i) qui ‘here’ and là ‘there’ have been consistently used more frequently throughout history compared to qua ‘here’ and lì ‘there’, respectively; and (ii) in present-day Italian, qui ‘here’ tends to refer to a location that is closer to the speaker than qua ‘here’ does, whereas là ‘there’ tends to refer to a location that is further away from the speaker than lì ‘there’ does. In summary, the iconic demonstrative pronouns (qui and là) are used more frequently and are closer to the prototypical meanings of ‘here’ and ‘there’. We argue that their frequency and prototypicality are motivated by their iconic power. This case study shows how iconicity may work as pressure on language use and language change.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Auditory and acoustic methods showed bidirectional vowel movement, with speakers converging on both the /ae/ and /e/ phonemes. Increasing velarization of the lateral has been posited as a factor in the development of the merger in Victoria, and thus /l/ quality was also investigated, with null results in terms of direct factors. The lateral, however, was shown to be dark in both syllable onset and coda positions, with evidence for /l/ being clearer in this age group when compared with younger speakers. Lexical frequency and orthography were also investigated as factors, the latter showing a significant effect and suggesting a role for velarization as a contrast maintenance strategy.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Further analyses revealed more engagement features overall deployed in 3MT presentations, especially those seeking to bring audiences into the discussion by mentioning them explicitly, directing them to think in certain ways, and addressing them with questions.

The variations are explained in terms of mode and context, especially the time-constrained and face-to-face competitive context of the spoken genre.

This study documents and describes subject elision in Kriol, a process where subject NPs are elided in a range of syntactic and discourse contexts. Through qualitative methods we describe the environments wherein subjects are elided and consider the relationship between elision licensed by the syntactic context, and elision licensed by the discourse context. The analysis reveals that subject elision can be licensed through antecedent–anaphora relations at the level of syntax and through the encoding of unambiguous, continued topics following the beginning of a narrative episode at the level of discourse.

When a person can use persuasive language effectively in speech and writing, it increases their ability to participate and access power in democratic societies. Persuasive writing is one of three key text types in the Australian Curriculum: English, and language features of persuasive text types are taught across the curriculum. Australian students’ ability to write persuasive texts has been assessed in seven of the past nine years of National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) testing. One of the language features that is considered important in persuasive writing is grammatical metaphor. This paper employs concepts from systemic functional linguistics (SFL) to examine how ideational grammatical metaphor was used in the 32 highest scoring persuasive texts written by Tasmanian primary and secondary school students for the 2011 NAPLAN test. The results show that high achieving students demonstrated an ability to use ideational metaphor in their persuasive writing from the middle primary school years. This paper aims to provide guidance for Australian primary and secondary school educators by showing how and in what ways high achieving students use grammatical metaphor for persuasive purposes in NAPLAN responses across the tested year levels.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

In this paper, I examine a number of uses of =lku, which require expanding and refining the ‘change of state’ analysis, in order to argue for a new analysis of =lku as a temporal and discourse clitic. The temporal function locates the event or state being modified by =lku in the temporal consequence of another event or state. This function interacts with lexical aspect, triggering an inference of the cessation of an ongoing state or event, if there is one, and encoding the inception of the state or event being modified by =lku. The discourse use of =lku frames new information which should be evaluated against the ongoing discourse. I also demonstrate some striking cross-linguistic similarities, showing that temporal morphemes commonly interact with discourse structure, just as =lku does in Warlpiri and Warlmanpa.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

The language contact situation is unusual cross-linguistically due to the high number of shared nouns, tending to an almost shared noun lexicon. Even more unusually, this lexicon was formed by borrowing in both directions at a relatively equal rate. The aim of this paper is to extend the bidirectional noun borrowing results to the verbal systems of Jingulu and Mudburra to determine whether a similarly high rate of borrowing occurred, and if so, whether it was similarly bidirectional. The high degree of shared Jingulu–Mudburra verb forms was first observed by Pensalfini who claimed that Jingulu and Mudburra lexical verbs are almost entirely cognate across these two languages. This paper aims to quantify the degree of shared verb forms and determine the direction of borrowing between Mudburra and Jingulu. We first establish shared forms and then determine the origins of the forms based on a comparative database of verbs from geographic and phylogenetic neighbours (Wambaya, Gurindji and Jaminjung).",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Based on a corpus of 160 research articles from eight disciplines, this study explores the authorial practice of this rhetorical choice, revealing how academic writers manage it to organize their arguments and persuade peers of their claims. In contrast to the style guides which recommend avoidance of unattended this, our data show that 35% of demonstrative this were unattended for rhetorical purposes in different knowledge fields. We also discuss differences in how writers in different disciplines favour diverse attending nouns to encapsulate the particular aspect of information their readers are likely to find most familiar, plausible and persuasive.

This research does not look at all the types of absolute clause, and thus one cannot draw general conclusions from it. Also, as the authors note, ‘the identification of functional categories is inevitably subjective’ (p. 162). Some items can be put into more than one category. Furthermore, SFL theory holds that categories do not have clear boundaries. Therefore, ‘many absolute clauses may have multiple interpretations’ (p. 162). He and Yang state, ‘when we identify the relation types realized by absolute clauses, we can only ascribe to them the most possible interpretation’ (p. 162). Thus some interpretations may not be correct. Further, the so-called quantitative analysis was carried out at a rather superficial level. The mechanism behind the diachronic distribution of absolute clauses has not been adequately explored and thus the analysis requires further explanation. For example, Piotrowski’s Law is not referred to in this research. Moreover, the classification of absolute clauses into syntactic types and the quantitative research do not constitute an organic whole, which will reduce the theoretical significance of the work. Despite these problems, this book contains an extensive treatment of absolute clauses and has made a contribution to SFL.

These questions are the titles of some of the sections of the chapter: ‘Why do teachers not use coursebooks in the way they’re expected to?’ (section 2), ‘Why do teachers not use systematic approaches to textbook selection and subsequent evaluation?’ (section 3) and ‘Why do teachers not involve learners in materials evaluation and development?’ (section 4). Part 3 of the book is entitled ‘Implications’; the implications that are meant are those coming out of the discussions in preceding chapters. Chapter 9 is on ‘Implications for teachers, managers, ministries, publishers and course book writers, and research’, while Chapter 10 is on ‘Implications for teacher educators: a practice-based proposal’. This book is a must-read for EFL/ESL teachers and those who educate them. McGrath, as one of the leading scholars in the field, rightfully addresses an area of materials development which seems to have been under-represented in the literature, and which seems to be opening up new horizons by giving more voice to teachers. However, this requires the teacher education system to provide in-service teachers with the training and experience needed to select, evaluate, adapt and even develop materials. McGrath is clearly asking for the process of materials development to be given a bottom-up form, allowing even students to act as players in it. This is in line with the thinking of scholars such as Kumaravadivelu (2006), who, in his explication of the principles of a ‘postmethod’ pedagogy and in his criticism of current top-down methods, calls for teachers to have more active roles in decisions on what to bring to their classes and what to do in them. As a teacher, I found the chapters in the second part of this book to be the most informative and practical; this is particularly true of the discussions of materials evaluation and adaptation. Overall, the book will provide a fruitful background for further studies in the field.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Using a combination of survey and corpus data, two distinct discourse functions are identified: resumptive topic marker and focus. Survey data from 170 linguistics students at an Australian university indicate a strong preference for the resumptive topic marker function: I argue that this is due to the parallel between discourse function and the structure of the standard relative clause. UWA corpus data suggest that the connective which is used solely to create textual cohesion in Australian English, while anecdotal examples from American English podcasts, blogs and the animated TV show Archer hint at the possibility of this becoming an expressive resource for speakers in the future.

Concerning the two types of Chinese existential constructions—existence and appearance/disappearance—we conclude that in either type the pre-Predicator locative element (a nominal group or a prepositional phrase) should be described as the Subject. This is essentially due to the fact that this locative element functions as a Participant Role in the transitivity structure of the clause.

Data from COCA concerning high-frequency adjectives or past-participles’ collocations with at and by indicate that recurring emotional adjectives or past-participles which precede at and by are, in contrast to other prepositions in emotion constructions, largely identical. The emotion terms of at and by share certain similarities in that they both arise suddenly and momentarily. However, their following nominals show distinctive aspects, specifically, complements of at focus on the resultant states and those of by describe events. This paper argues that this difference is attributable to the schematic meanings of the prepositions. Although both prepositions express causality of momentary emotion, they have different schematic meanings, viz. target (at) and agent (by). Given the schematic meaning of target, the nominals following at are static and resultative. In contrast, since the schematic meaning of agen...",Australian Journal of Linguistics

One major shift has occurred in the use of cardinal directions (N–S–E–W) to express spatial relations. Where older Gurindji adults use 28 inflected forms for each cardinal to describe large and small-scale space, young adults use four forms and only for large-scale space. This paper examines Gurindji children’s knowledge of cardinals to determine whether this change is continuing or has stabilized. The ‘Which-way-is’ task was devised and administered to 53 children and 56 adults. While adults gave 95% correct responses, children gave fewer correct responses (50%) and showed no significant improvement across age groups, although their ability to give a correct response improved significantly if they were asked to point to a location rather than to name the cardinal (78%).

This article examines language and participation in a digitally enabled preschool classroom as students engage with teachers and peers. Ethnomethodology, conversation analysis and membership categorization analysis are used to explicate video-recorded episodes of students (aged 3-5 years) interacting while using a laptop and a tablet. Attending to the sequential organization (when, how) and the context relevance (where) of talk and interaction, analysis shows how the intersection of interactions involving the teacher, students and digital devices, shape the ways that talk and interactions unfold. Analysis found that the teacher-student interactions were jointly arranged around a participation framework that included: 1) the teacher’s embodied action that mobilizes an accompanying action by a student, 2) allocation of turn-taking and participation while using a digital device and, 3) the affordances of the digital device in relation to the participants’ social organization. In this way, it is possible to understand not just what a digital device is or does, but the affordances of what it makes possible in constituting teachers’ and students’ social and learning relationships.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

We propose that *ko-marked nominals are focused, according to a precise semantic definition of focus as a syntactic feature that triggers a semantic object (discourse alternatives). First, we show that this semantic account of focus predicts a range of *ko structures found in verb-initial Polynesian systems, including clefts, equatives, topics, wh-questions and forms with focus-sensitive expressions like ‘only'.

Moreover, constructionists stipulate that lexical–constructional fusion is regulated by some constraints (e.g. Goldberg’s semantic constraints or Michaelis’ Override Principle).

Close analysis of supervisory meetings shows that students sometimes pause following their supervisor's talk, when a response or an uptake is due. The question for supervisors, especially of international students, is how to treat student pauses, given that such pauses could either foreshadow a dispreferred response or a problem of intersubjectivity.

The view is that this change is the result of Austronesian speakers’ bilingualism in a Papuan language, and therefore that Austronesian speakers were the agents of change. The article presents an alternative scenario—that the grammatical change may have been the result of a process involved in acquisition of the Austronesian language by Papuan speakers, who then would have been the agents of change. This scenario is supported by a description of similarities in the changed grammatical features of the Austronesian languages and those of contact languages, which clearly did arise from a process of acquisition—namely, language transfer. It is also supported by the degree of lexical borrowing in at least one of the changed Austronesian languages, Takia, which suggests acquisition rather than bilingualism played a key role.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

It makes a diachronic comparative analysis of illustrative examples from two editions of A New English–Chinese Dictionary and finds that as the recontextualizers (the dictionary compilers) re-situate the source dictionary in a new context, elements of the prior lexicographic discourse are placed in new perspectives and orientations, brought to the foreground or pushed to the background. By showing how the recontextualizers attempt to de-politicize the words and examples in the source dictionary by using d...",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Using unelicited conversational data recorded in primary school classrooms, we present an analysis of the formal and functional properties of la. In terms of formal properties, we classify la as a final particle and observe that it frequently collocates with the deictic demonstratives ere (here) and dere (dere) and the visual perception verbs look and see. In our functional analysis we show that la is employed when the speaker is directing an interlocutor to jointly attend with the speaker to a specific object or action within the here-and-now environment—a function that is rare among discourse particles. We also discuss the possible origins of this particle in terms of substrate influences from traditional Australian languages or borrowing from other contact varieties.

These nouns, labelled here as ‘shell nouns’, have been extensively investigated but, so far, the research focus has been on a limited range of patterns, meanings and functions. This is demonstrated here through a review of three widely held assumptions about shell nouns, namely that they are contextually unspecific and semantically abstract, that they encapsulate or package stretches of text, and that they favour definite and demonstrative determiners (e.g. this, these). The value of this paper, therefore, lies in its critical review and appraisal of previous and current research on shell-nounhood, with special emphasis on its complexity and on some of the challenges and gaps to be addressed and filled in by future research.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

This propels some systemicists to think of the inclusion of textual metaphor into grammatical metaphor since the three metafunctions are intertwined, and to carry out research on textual metaphor from different perspectives. However, Halliday has never discussed textual metaphor, only mentioning the textual effects of ideational metaphor. Following the notion of cline, we propose that the relation between the two figures of a sequence can be realized along two lines, one being the unidirectional transfer from the conjunctive adverbial groups through paratactic and hypotactic conjunction groups to preposition groups, the other being that from the conjunctive adverbial groups through paratactic and hypotactic conjunction groups to verbal groups and finally to nominal groups.

The sample of 18 American English speakers (male and female) identified ideal American English vowels from sets of synthetic vowels, and the same participants produced those vowels in a clear speaking style. The formant values of the produced vowels were measured and compared with those of perceived vowels on the vowel space. The results show that a vast majority of the perceived vowel spaces of the male and female groups were not significantly different, whereas the produced vowel spaces of the two groups were significantly different.

Its main thesis is non-standard and provocative and thus I predict that it will trigger many important reactions. It is an offspring of naturalism and is an attempt to naturalize philosophy. For every assertion of an abstract type the authors offer detailed evidence coming from philosophy of mind, physiology, etc. At one point they express some scepticism concerning the idea that adequate progress in a philosophical investigation should follow from an interest in linguistic matters—the idea that philosophy should be reduced to linguistics. Since I have, on various occasions, connected the analysis of important philosophical problems with linguistic analysis, I accept the general idea that naturalization can be approved of as a philosophical method, although allowing that in some cases naturalization also involves detailed analysis of linguistic phenomena (so that I agree that linguistic analysis is not all there is to philosophy). The title of this book (The Price of Language) carries a negative implicature (whether conversational or conventional is debatable): we need to pay a price for the complexities and usefulness of language. Reading the book we realize that the authors think that the use of language is responsible for the ultimate (possible) extinction of mankind (a rather catastrophic view, I should suppose). Human beings are conquering (and devastating) every small allotment of land and are in perennial war(s). Language is what allows human beings to do all this (primarily through the formation of concepts, the use of speech acts, cultural propagation, etc.). (It is not difficult to imagine how language can be put to the service of all malevolent purposes, including enabling human beings to form (and carry out or execute) bad intentions.) Pennisi and Falzone have tackled a difficult, thorny and undoubtedly open-ended issue with the help of tools coming from cognitive science, broadly understood. In fact, the authors put a great deal of their knowledge to use in the construction of this ambitious and without doubt interesting project, so it would be fair to say that the project is interdisciplinary.

It elucidates for us the fact that Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language), a robust text-based programming language and word string manipulation system, can offer language researchers a powerful and user-friendly platform to extract and process language datasets accurately. In quantitative linguistic studies, one of the most challenging problems that researchers come across is that there are hardly any ‘ready-made’ language processing software tools which can be versatile enough to overcome all the technical difficulties in natural language processing (NLP). In this respect, the volume under review may be an ideal course book for those who attempt to use computer programming for their research. In this book Fan introduces a large variety of operators and functions of Perl programming. Its intended readership is broad, including students, teachers, language researchers and anyone who shows an interest in computational linguistics, NLP, data mining or data-driven general linguistics. It will be particularly useful for researchers who employ a quantitative approach. Though Perl code may appear to be difficult to understand for those whose computer programming knowledge is at an elementary level, this book does not require readers to have previous experience in or knowledge about computer programming, and it provides clear step-by-step instructions which even general readers will find very easy to follow. Nevertheless, the author has advised that users of the book should not just read it, but should also take the time to repeatedly practise the operators, commands, functions and programmes described in it. He suggests that readers will need at least 36 in-class/ laboratory hours to hone their Perl skills before they are able to write creative computer programmes.

Lexical bundles are frequently used in academic discourse, and contribute to the production of coherence in speech and written language, as well as playing a central role in the comprehension of academic speech. Previous research has shown that L2 speakers often show a capacity to approximate native-like efficiency by using lexical bundles in their speech and writing. However, it has not been analysed as to what degree L2 speakers follow native expressions or rather use their own variations or versions of formulaic expressions. In order to investigate this gap, the most frequent four-word lexical bundles were identified and analysed in two different corpora of classroom discussions by native and non-native speakers, and compared in terms of discourse function.

We demonstrate a remarkably symmetrical vowel space, highlighting where the six vowels lie acoustically in relation to each other for the three speakers overall, and for each speaker individually.

The present study pursues the following objectives: (a) to trace the origin and development of this intensifier in English; (b) to cast light on the lexical semantic structure of the right-hand collocates in terms of their mode of construal and their attitudinal features; and (c) to describe the developmental path of this intensifier from a contentful to a configurational meaning.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

However, there is no consensus on membership of this class, and temporal adverbial expressions such as (at) the moment (that) can be seen as borderline cases. This paper will argue that the emergence of the fully elliptical form—the moment—with zero preposition and zero that in an ambiguous context allows the reanalysis of an adverbial adjunct introducing a relative clause as a subordinator. Corpus data from the Australian, British and US ICE corpora are used to demonstrate which of a set of these temporal adverbials are most likely to be emerging in this subordinator role.

Based on syntactic evidence, we distinguish the plain form subjunctive, which includes the traditional mandative subjunctive, from the were subjunctive.

This poses a significant problem for a researcher who wishes to access the original recordings of speech in order to analyse variation: how can they search for relevant data? Many transcription traditions allow for the representation of such variation through non-standard orthography, and such conventions should therefore allow access to data relevant to the study of variation. However, the specific conventions used vary between traditions (and indeed may not be applied consistently by individual transcribers). This then creates another problem where the researcher wishes to access data across an aggregated collection, which is a practical necessity given the relatively limited size of most corpora of spoken language. In this paper, we analyse the conventions used in two of the component collections in the Australian National Corpus, the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus and the Monash Corpus of Spoken English. On the basis of this analysis, we develop a fragment of an ontology which gives an explicit account of the phenomena related to non-standard pronunciation represented in the transcripts and which can therefore act as the basis for better searching of the collections and better access to relevant data for analysing sociolinguistic and stylistic variation.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

There are also terms for intermediate directions and probably sea and land breezes, and terms relatable to the sun and tides. A recent treatment of the wind direction data by Gibson, who draws as well on work by Troy, interprets the records as indicating that some word meanings shift so much according to context that he questions whether the Sydney Language had words at all. However, there is order discernible here, fitting with regional evidence for the salience of cardinal directions.

In addition to the above mentioned grammatical functions, it has a different functional behaviour.

Additional evidence of such nominality has been drawn from the fact that in many of those languages a determiner can indeed top the CP projection (D + CP), thus creating a DP. In standard Spanish, speakers may optionally add such a determiner under certain semantic circumstances. Spanish finite clauses in principle fall under such a syntactic account. However, despite their nominal distribution, a constraint remains which apparently challenges such generalization. Finite clauses introduced by the complementizer que (‘that’)—que-clauses—may not combine with a determiner in spite of meeting all expected requirements.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank the participants and the audience for their comments and suggestions. We are also grateful to the editor of AJL, Keith Allan, for giving us this opportunity. The workshop brought together specialists from both sides of the Pacific working on a variety of topics within Romance Linguistics, ranging from phonological analysis to syntax and discourse. The rationale behind this workshop was to celebrate the establishment of a research group in the field at the School of Language Studies at the ANU, in particular Hispanic Linguistics. This special edition marks the launch of the Romance Linguistics in the Antipodes (RomLA) virtual research centre, which aims to provide a platform for researchers in Australia and New Zealand, and to facilitate collaborations and networking with colleagues outside of Oceania. The papers are organized in alphabetical order, which coincidentally allows us to organize the papers according to theoretical frameworks and/or topics. In the first paper, Delicado Cantero addresses clausal substantivization in Spanish. After introducing a formal syntactic account of finite clauses and clausal nominalization in Spanish, a language where a DP may optionally top a CP in certain contexts, the author concentrates on two main issues. The first is the unexpected constraint barring the combination of prepositions and clauses introduced by determiners. While DPs make typical prepositional complements, BD CP in Spanish results in ungrammaticality if selected by a preposition. Building on the weak nature of the Spanish complementizer que and on interpolation tests, the author argues for the application of strict adjacency between P and C, thus blocking a potential DP projection. The author goes on to argue against the need for the determiner layer*a DP*in creating a nominal (finite) clause, and supports a differentiation between the nominality of the (finite) clause and the projection of an additional DP, labelled clausal substantivization.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

On the synchronic side, the focus is on the spread of ge- in the derivational morphology of the language and the assessment of productivity, while on the diachronic side the emphasis is on the lexicalization and grammaticalization of the affix at stake. A path of grammaticalization is described as starting from the Proto-Germanic derivational prefix *ga- and leading to inflectional ge- in Old English. Quantitative evidence is gathered in favour of a progressive loss of the derivational productivity of the prefix that is paralleled by a gradual increase in inflectional distribution.

Making Sense of English Rhyming Compounds,2012,"Rhyming compounds, such as helter-skelter or prime time, where the two constituents that make up the compound itself rhyme with one another, are one of the least investigated categories of English word formation. While they have been a regular feature of English for centuries, and are a common phenomenon in present-day English, too, they have often been overlooked in the literature on the grounds that they are a marginal, playful feature of the English language, which do not merit a systematic and proper analysis in their own right. However, there is much more to rhyming compounds than meets the eye. The paper challenges the marginality of rhyming compounds in general, and demonstrates that the meaning of such compounds is inextricably linked to the rhyming quality, i.e. the form.

Thus temporal progression is also inferred. We propose to represent this contrast as a presupposition that -rru introduces, using Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). We also show that in discourse, -rru is used to introduce new subtopics, thus expressing contrasts at this wider level as well.

Crucial to this positive definition is the interaction of third-person pronouns in the extended animacy hierarchy posited by Croft. The particular participation in the extended animacy hierarchy by third-person pronouns accounts for the diversity evidenced cross-linguistically, from sharing morphological traits with first- and second-person pronouns to having demonstrative–anaphoric multifunctionality in which demonstratives have both deictic and anaphoric functions.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

At first sight, this looks like construction conveying grammatical aspect, specifically progressive, since it bears both formal and functional resemblances to typical progressive constructions. At closer investigation, however, the two morphemes crucially involved in the construction, a grammatical morpheme = mayan and a ‘semantically light’ inflecting verb, in their combination can be shown to convey lexical rather than grammatical aspect:=mayan, which occurs in a wider range of contexts, can be analysed as a marker of iterativity, and the inflecting verbs -yu ‘be’ and -ijga ‘go’ signal atelicity of different flavours, and are selected as classificatory verbs in analogy to other closed-class verbs in complex predicates in Jaminjung.

Although regional variation in the Australian accent remains under-investigated, some signs of regional vowel differences have been found, suggesting that data from other regional centres must also be considered to accurately assess the nature and extent of vowel change. This study contributes to the ongoing re-assessment of Australian vowel characteristics by examining formant data of the /hVd/ vowels of 13 female and nine male adolescents from Melbourne, in relation to recent data from Sydney and Adelaide and earlier data from New South Wales.

This paper shows that the overall evidence favours one of the hypotheses. The ‘cost’ of this favoured hypothesis lies in an increase in the complexity and the irregularity of Arandic phonotactics.

The paper first surveys the different mechanisms available for marking a shift from the narrator's deictic centre to a narrative participant, including a number of constructions that use perception and motion predicates to signal RST. The analysis then focuses on the narrative functions of RST, showing that it has a macrostructural function beyond the representation of a specific participant's speech and thought, more specifically highlighting the central episodes of a narrative. The evidence comes from an analysis of three genres with a different macrostructure: one (personal history) for which the classic Labovian schema of complication–resolution works well and two others (both dealing with the supernatural world) that rely on different structuring principles.

Several seminal arguments for new and high-profile phonological theories are now based at least in part upon analyses of Hale’s data set. After reviewing what is of such interest in Lardil, a body of data is assembled which alters our understanding of the empirical facts and theoretical implications of Lardil phonology. Hale’s process of Laminalization is reanalyzed as Apicalization; constrained lexical exceptions are found with respect to Apocope, Apicalization and Truncation; and a process of Raising is identified. A discussion of the systematicity of these new data, and of their demonstrable antiquity leads to the conclusion that future formal analyses of the language must account not only for already well-known properties of the data, but for the existence of multiple, active patterns that apply selectively throughout the lexicon.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Some of these alternations have been hitherto analysed as lenition (e.g. Yolngu), while others have been argued to be hardening processes (e.g. Wubuy). Lenition processes of this kind are difficult to account for in various models of phonology, because they are conditioned by a two-sided context. This paper presents an analysis, couched in Optimality Theory, of one such lenition pattern in Gaalpu, a Yolngu variety. I show that the process can be succinctly analysed in terms of two constraints: a constraint on consonant strength across syllable boundaries, and a constraint against non-continuants in a sonorous context (following Kingston's [2008] recent work). I argue that this analysis is superior to existing accounts precisely because it is able to capture the role of both the preceding segment and following segment in conditioning lenition.

It is demonstrated that while definiteness and specificity are not contrastive features in Niuean, a feature encoding focused and new information is central to the Niuean nominal system.

Meanings are expressed in explications using the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM), which uses reductive paraphrase to describe each verb in terms of simpler prime concepts; this allows direct comparison of their semantic content.

Tai Phake (Tai Kadai/South Western Tai) is a tone language with six contrastive tones. The paper proposes that where a song style allows the realization of these tones in singing, greater freedom in syntactic structure is possible, and vice-versa.

They were originally presented at a panel on talk-in-interaction in Indigenous communities at the 11th International Pragmatics Conference held at the University of Melbourne in July 2009. All the papers*the first four in this issue*are distinctive in using a Conversation Analytic (CA) approach to studying interaction. Since Moerman’s study of Thai and Lue talk in Northern Thailand, for which the field work was carried out in the 1960s, and which was published in 1988, there has indeed been very little CA work on small Indigenous languages anywhere in the world. It is only in recent years that the lens of CA has been applied to Australian Indigenous conversation, mainly by the authors represented in this collection. Blythe is a relatively recent PhD graduate whose thesis from Sydney University was on person reference in Murriny-Patha (Blythe 2009). Rendle-Short, one of Australia’s leading CA scholars, has only recently turned her attention to Indigenous interaction. Her co-author, Karin Moses, is another recent PhD graduate from the University of Melbourne (Moses 2009), who has extensive experience in Indigenous education in the Northern Territory. She notes how little we know about Aboriginal language use, especially with young children. Mushin has over 10 years’ experience of linguistic field work in the Northern Territory, and in recent years has collaborated with Gardner, a pioneer of Australian Conversation Analysis, to study aspects of conversational interaction in Garrwa (Gardner & Mushin 2007; Mushin & Gardner 2009). Whilst this work is new, it is indebted to earlier sociolinguistic and discourse studies of Aboriginal languages. Michael Walsh’s ethnographic work has alerted us to aspects of conversational style, such as multi-addressee ‘broadcast talk’, and the non-dyadic and continuous nature of Indigenous conversation, in which talk is directed to ‘no particular individual and there need not be any direct response’ (Walsh 1991), and in which extended silences are the norm. This last point is also made by Diana Eades (e.g. Eades 2000), who has worked particularly on legal settings. She also notes that there appears to be no obligation for an addressee to answer questions. Kenneth Liberman",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Liddicoat,Communication as Culturally Contexted Practice: A View from Intercultural Communication,2009,"This paper explores the interrelationship between culture, language and communication and examines dimensions of the impact of culture on the act and process of communication. It will argue that instances of language use in communication (linguistic acts) are inseparable from the cultural context in which they are created and in which they are received. Culture impacts on communication at a number of levels. It constitutes a frame in which utterances are conveyed and interpreted: what is communicated depends as much on the cultural context in which the communication occurs as it does on the elements from which the linguistic act is constructed. Culture also influences how the linguistic act itself is constructed, affecting text types and the properties and purposes of textual structures. Aspects of communication such as sequencing, recipient design and impact are read within a framework of cultural understandings about valued and appropriate language use. In addition, culture has an impact on understandin...",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Although the address term mate (as in How ya going mate?) is generally included in discussions of mate and mateship, very little analysis of how it is actually used in Australian English has been carried out. This preliminary study focuses on the vocative use of mate through a survey of 698 respondents in which they were asked whether they use mate when addressing other people, whether they are addressed by mate, who they predominantly address as mate and whether they like mate as a term of address. The results show that there seems to be a shift in terms of how mate, as an address term, is used and understood. Whereas mate has traditionally been understood as a male solidarity term used ‘by males and for males’, this preliminary survey shows that more young women, aged between 18 and 29 years, ar...",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Upon closer examination of various pragmatic phenomena in discourse, however, it appears the situation is actually much more complex than the standard conceptualization of communication in pragmatics allows. In particular, it is suggested in this paper that the focus on expressing and recognizing/attributing (speaker) intentions underestimates the dynamic nature and complexity of cognition that underpins interaction. The notion of 'dyadic cognizing' is thus introduced as a way of reconceptualizing the inferential work that underlies communication. It is suggested that such inferential work is 'directed' and thus is inherently 'intentional' in the sense proposed by Brentano, but need not necessarily be 'directed' towards the 'intentions' of speakers.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

The results suggest that the cognitive status of and word pairs as being the ‘same’ or ‘different’ is not entirely related to their production. This status could be affected by functional load: words that could lead to contextual ambiguity may seem more different than those for which the distinction is not functionally important. The results also provide evidence that an experimenter's dialect area can influence participants’ production of these diphthongs. Participants in this study were met by two different experimenters from different dialect regions: New Zealand and the United States.

Speech pathology is often described as a communication science. The key to understanding how speech pathologists conceptualize communication lies in understanding how speech pathologists as a profession deal with the notion of what constitutes effective communication. Typically speech pathologists identify communication as effective when both the speaker and the listener have executed their roles to an age expected level within the biological capabilities of the individual. The way speech pathologists talk about communication identifies their conceptualization of communication as primarily a biological process.

The present results are compared with results presented in Tabain & Perrier from three French speakers producing the high back rounded vowel /u/. The differences in articulatory strategies and in acoustic variability are discussed with respect to the vowel inventory of each language.

The difference is that while the Japanese imperfective marker does focus on the resultant stage by triggering the resultant state reading, the English imperfective marker does not have such a function. In English, the seeming result meaning arises only from the cause–effect connection between the state depicted by the imperfective sentence and the situation which brings about that state.

I argue that the presence vs. absence of the ergative marker in this environment is not random free variation, but is motivated and highly constrained. The paper is concerned with identifying the motivations. It is proposed, based on an investigation of uses in a corpus of narrative and other texts, that two features are relevant: (a) semantic—the subject is highly agentive; and (b) referential—the identity of the subject is not predictable: it is unexpected. Use of the ergative on an intransitive subject thus highlights both the agentivity and the unexpectedness of the subject. I argue that, contrary to recent claims by some, Warrwa is not an active language: it is not the case that -na∼-ma groups together some intransitive and transitive subjects, while zero marking groups some intransitive subjects with transitive ...",Australian Journal of Linguistics

In this paper, within an RST conceptualization of text organization, I propose that there are rhetorical subgroupings (or bands) between the local level of text organization, which is grammaticalized by clause complexing, and the upper most level of text organization, which potentially coincides with generic structure. Based on a quantitative analysis, I present a way of viewing text organization in terms of these rhetorical subgroupings within a text that is determined by clause complex boundary and text span size. The corpus used in this study comprises six undergraduate essays that were analysed using RST.

Traditionally the Māori plosive consonants are regarded as unaspirated, in contrast to English voiceless plosives which are strongly aspirated in initial position. This paper traces the increase in aspiration in Māori plosives over time by analysing the Māori and English plosive consonants of three speakers born over a span of nearly 100 years. It shows that both the number of aspirated plosives and the degree of aspiration (measured by VOT) have increased from the oldest speaker (born in 1885) to the youngest speaker (born in 1972) in both languages. There may be some language internal factors at work, but influence from English is a likely cause for this change. The youngest speaker was born before the Māori language revitalization programme was established. The results provide a snapshot of the pronunciation of Māori stops before the development of the kōhanga reo revitalization movement (Māori language nests) in 1982.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Grammatical Categories in Australian Languages AIAS Canberra: 78–105 at 78]. Since this paper, almost every Australian grammar makes some reference to this clause type, presenting a general picture of structural homogeneity across subordination structures in Australian languages, and leading to the general perception that Australian languages typically don't have syntactic embedding. In this paper I present an analysis of subordinate clauses in Wambaya, arguing that these share many features of Hale's ‘adjoined relative clause’ while still being clearly subordinate. The differences between subordinate clauses in Warlpiri and Wambaya show that complex constructions in Australian languages can be structurally dissimilar while sharing many of the properties of the ‘adjoined relative clause’ type. I argue, therefore, that clause-combining in Australian languages may be more structurally heterogeneous than is traditionally assumed, and that a single analysis for complex sentences across a majority of Australian languages is quite likely inappropriate.

,Jean-Christophe Verstraete,The Nature of Irreality in the Past Domain: Evidence from Past Intentional Constructions in Australian Languages,2006,"This study investigates an unusual pattern of mood marking found in the past-tense counterparts of purposive and apprehensive complex sentences in some Australian languages. The secondary clause in these constructions, which will be called past intentional constructions, is typically marked for mood even though the event described is often known to have taken place, and in some cases the mood markers have counterfactual meanings even though the constructions as such do not have any counterfactual meaning. It is argued that past intentional constructions can be defined on the basis of a combination of two features: (1) mood marking in the secondary clause, which adduces a semantic feature of (un)desirability; and (2) a link of this mood to the agent of the main clause, which creates a relation of intended or avoided realization between the main clause and the secondary clause. This analysis can help both to motivate the presence of mood marking in these constructions, and to explain the apparently unmotivated use of mood markers with counterfactual meaning, which is shown to be a cancellable implicature rather than a basic meaning of the mood markers in question. In addition, the analysis also suggests that purposive, apprehensive and past intentional constructions constitute a formally and functionally intermediate category between constructions of speech and thought representation and constructions of adverbial modification.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Multiple Subordination Strategies in Dalabon,2006,"Dalabon, typically for a polysynthetic language, only employs subordinate clauses with low frequency (less than 5% in the corpus surveyed). Despite this, it has a number of formally distinct subordinate clause types, which are described in this paper. Pronominal prefixes to the verb have special subordinate forms, possibly deriving from a reanalysis of comitative applicative prefixes as subordinate markers; verbs so marked are used for a range of subordinate clause functions. It is also possible to incorporate one verb form inside another, to add case suffixes (locative, temporal and purposive) to inflected verbs, and to employ bare verbs stripped of their (otherwise obligatory) pronominal prefixes. The existence of so many subordination strategies suggests that claims about the lack of subordination in polysynthetic languages represent statistical correlations, rather than categorical requirements, and that it is perfectly possible for polysynthetic languages to possess a range of subordinate structures.",Australian Journal of Linguistics
,Alan Dench,Case Marking Strategies in Subordinate Clauses in Pilbara Languages: Some Diachronic Speculations,2006,"This paper considers possible diachronic explanations for the range of case marking patterns found in subordinate clauses in languages of the Pilbara region of Western Australia. There are two parameters to consider in comparing patterns across the area. First, complements and adjuncts of verbs in dependent clauses may have patterns of case marking different from those of independent finite clauses. Second, nominal suffixes functioning as complementizing case may occur either just on the verb of the dependent clause or on all subconstituents of the dependent clause. Two possible paths of development for subordinate clauses are described. Some dependent clauses arise out of nominalizations through the instantiation of a nominalized verb’s argument structure and in languages with a high degree of multiple case marking it follows naturally that in such clauses complementizing case would be distributed to all subconstituents. Other dependent clause types arise through changes in which main clause adjuncts of different kinds are reanalyzed as arguments of a nominalized verb. The recognition of these different sources explains a range of complex patterns of case marking choice in subordinate clauses and provides an account of the distribution of complementizing case in different construction types and in different languages.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Reviewing several major works that cover Japanese society and its language, the present article argues that the collectivist view of the Japanese self is incompatible with essential features of the Japanese language. Through an examination of addressing and kinship terms, honorific and polite expressions, donatory verbs, psychological predicates, the pronoun jibun, and private (as opposed to public) expressions, it is demonstrated that (i) Japanese requires a notion of an absolute self that is strictly distinct from others and cannot be assimilated into one's in-group, and (ii) the distinction of the two aspects of the speaker, public and private self, is crucial to the analysis of the Japanese self.

Evidence, from clauses with inherently pragmatically marked nominals and adjunct nominal constructions, is presented to support the phrase-structural analysis.

Examination of the phonetic features that are correlated with the contrast indicate that not only duration of constriction, but also voicing through the closed phase and voice onset time play a role in its realization. Consideration is then given to the possible phonological analyses of this contrast. Three types of analysis, prosodic, segmental and geminate, are discussed, and while a prosodic interpretation of the Jawoyn data appears untenable, there is no clear evidence to indicate that either a segmental or geminate phonological analysis is more appropriate.

The discourse is largely concerned with ‘British’ or ‘English’ dialects, although Irish English is often found under the heading of ‘British’. There is a prevailing theory in works concerned with Australian English that there was a movement of people within the British Isles towards the larger towns, and London in particular, and that any distinctive dialect would have been modified as a result of exposure to the dominant London one.

There is an ongoing controversy about whether strings such as Kam's should be viewed as coverb or as matrix verb. In the light of the Kam data, the coverb hypothesis is rejected and the matrix verb hypothesis strengthened on three fronts. First, the string functions as a simple verb meaning 'touch'. It exhibits a large patient-noun paradigm ranging from concrete physical objects to abstract relational nouns (e.g. 'event', 'calamity'). The suggestion deduced is that the Kam passive can be viewed as a kind of metaphorical touching of events. Second, the -construction displays properties for the deletion of coreferential arguments and resembles other matrix clauses in this regard.

Culturally speaking, shouted speech is a natural expression of the importance and centrality of CH community and corresponding authority structures. Shouted speech, as will be discussed, has a very strong hortatory function, based upon the authority of village chiefs. Basically, this speech phenomenon serves as a vehicle by which the language community is called into action, and thus is a catalyst for organizing and moving ahead as a community-wide unit, both in daily business and for certain special functions.

Thus the structure of the discourse is inherently important in considering the functioning of anaphoric systems. Fox's principle of morphosyntactic markedness is invoked to account for this aspect of the multifunctionality of anaphoric expressions. The paper then extends the argument to show that non-nominal reference tracking systems may also obey this principle, on the basis of the examination of cross-linguistic data from switch-reference systems which indicates that so-called 'Different Subject' markers often function to indicate a break in the discourse rather than simply a change in subject referent.

Yet it is shown here, first, that McCawley's formulation of that distinction is inaccurate, since it is based on a flawed application of the criteria he himself proposes.

One such area in which change still seems to be in progress is the marking of conditional clauses.

The Ergative, and to a lesser extent the Dative, case suffixes have come to be used as optional indicators of discourse prominence in addition to maintaining their original case‐marking uses. Some other head‐marking non‐Pama‐Nyungan languages may also use case markers in non‐case functions, but the Jingulu system differs from these in two important respects: the Jingulu innovation appears to be extremely recent (30–40 years) and the Jingulu system uses all core case markers, not just one particular marker, for this function. One possible explanation for this innovation in Jingulu involves re‐analysis of the case markers resulting from the dominant and increasing influence of the English language on the final generations of Jingulu speakers.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

In this article I demonstrate that the pronominal prefixing found in Maung is broadly a split‐ergative system, and that through reference to the alignment categories distinguished by the prefixes, not the syntactic roles (A, S or O), we can find a set of principles behind the variations in prefix order, which are modelled in a set of constraints following the principles of Optimality Theory.

Instead, a framing analysis of reported speech is elaborated, according to which the quoted utterance is contained within the scope of the clause of speech. This permits a systematic treatment of direct and indirect speech, and an explanation of their contrasting grammatical properties. It is further argued that the syntagmatic relationship involved is a sign, the signified of which is an interpersonal meaning: the clause of speech modifies the reported clause much as the particle utharri ’mistakenly believe’ modified the clause it holds in its scope.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Initial generative descriptions of gerundives attempt to resolve this conflict by assimilating these constructions to unambiguously nominal or clausal categories, or by assigning the discordant properties to different derivational levels. The alternative articulated here follows Schachter 1976 and Jackendoff 1977 in associating these conflicting properties with different projections in a phrase structure analysis. Gerundives are analyzed as nominal phrases headed by present participles, which, as verbal categories, maintain a predominantly verbal argument structure and interpretation. Following Pullum 1991, the clash between the category of a gerundive phrase and its lexical head is not simply stipulated, but rather attributed to the default projection of constitutive ‘head’ features, as proposed in extended phrase struc...",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Evidence from Bunuba generally supports this claim, but Bunuba ‘say’ clauses themselves vary in transitivity: some have ergative‐marked subjects and some absolutive. The difference is correlated with the extent to which the reported locution is being represented as a discrete speech event. Also relevant is the presence or absence on the verb of oblique cross‐reference to an addressee, which may independently condition ergative marking on the subject even in the absence of a reported locution. What most complicates the question of transitivity for these Bunuba constructions is that there are two competing candidates for object status (locution and addressee): their overall transitivity is not simply intermediate, but potentially ambiguous. Similar considerations may explain the anomalous behaviour of ‘say’ clauses in other languages.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Gao,Dōu as a wide scope universal quantifier,1994,"May (1977, 1985) argues that the rule of Quantifier Raising (QR), which is an instance of Move 8 is operative at the level of Logic Form (LF) in English. Based on the assumption that QR is operative at the level of S‐Structure (SS) in Chinese and that the lexical item dōu is relevant to the application of QR at SS in Chinese (Gao 1989, 1990), this paper, by demonstrating a set of properties of dōu, aims to argue that dōu is a wide scope universal quantifier. The paper intends to demonstrate that a quantifier which co‐occurs with dōu is unambiguous and always has wide scope; that a wh‐question word becomes a universal quantifier if it co‐occurs with dou and again it always has wide scope; that dōu forces an NP or a QP in the object position to move preverbally and thus forces it to have wide scope interpretation; and that even an existential quantifier or an ordinary noun or noun phrase will have universal presupposition if it appears with dōu.

In terms of its association with other grammatical features, its areal distribution, and its consistency in genetic groupings, ergativity proves to be a recessive phenomenon, while stative‐active is not recessive but simply low in frequency. This makes the high frequency of ergativity in two continents even more unexpected. The continental asymmetries cannot be explained as reflecting the evolution of language or founder effects in the peopling of continents. Most of them have resulted accidentally from structural and genetic skewings created by spread zones in continental interiors. The alignment asymmetries sug...",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Gilyak lenition involves spirantization of stops when these stops are preceded by stops, vowels or glides. Underspecified representations are used to express Gilyak lenition as a context‐sensitive feature‐filling rule triggered by the natural class of segments lacking values for the distinctive feature [continuant]. Relative Underspecification, which combines the phonological grounding of Naive Underspecification with the predictive power of Radical and Restricted Underspecification models, is proposed. Relative Underspecification takes into account both the binary/ privative status of a feature, and the presence or absence of evidence for that feature within the phonology.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

Some debate exists over the extent to which this “jargon” was structurally stable and lexically developed beyond an absolutely minimal stage. This paper argues that the jargon was possibly not as lexically impoverished as some have argued. Evidence is presented in the form of possible loans from South Seas Jargon into Pacific languages by 1860 that there were almost 250 items of cultural vocabulary in circulation, which would necessarily have been used along with a somewhat larger set of non‐cultural vocabulary. If this is so, then the so‐called “jargon” period in the development of Pacific pidgins and creoles needs to be, fairly drastically shortened.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

The analysis is limited to sentences which have animate causers. From the analysis of such sentences, it can be demonstrated that the two constructions have similar but distinct meanings. The hacer‐plus‐subjunctive construction encodes some idea of intentionality which is absent from the hacer‐plus‐infinitive construction.

The constructions are here claimed to share in common the presence of an element ‘external’ to the governing clause, but to exhibit certain differences both in terms of their structural properties (notably, the types of syntactic function represented by the external element in the governing clause), and in terms of their communicative discourse properties. Left extern constructions foreground an element which, in the vast majority of cases, serves as a topic‐expression. One type generally serves to redirect the flow of the discourse by reintroducing a lapsed topic and presenting new information relevant to that topic via the governing clause.

We examine two sociolinguistic variables from interviews with 75 mainly working‐class speakers and compare them with other dialects of English. Our findings challenge the view that NZE has little or no dropping of word‐initial /h/. We found a modest mean level of HDROP among our speakers ‐ much less than found in Britain, but slightly more than in Australia. HDROP exceeded 30 percent among some groups, and 70 percent for a few individual speakers. Men used much more HDROP than women. HDROP was favoured particularly by older and middle‐aged Maori speakers, and avoided by older Pakeha [European] women. The variable ING, which realizes the velar nasal in [i?] as the alveolar [n], is as stable a sociolinguistic marker in NZE as elsewhere.

In this paper, I show that the possession of part terms in the languages of Tanna (Vanuatu) is rather more complex than this. Different part terms participate in different construction types, and a distinction must be made between those part terms which are seen as being relatively inalienable, and are thus normally not removed, and nouns which refer to less inalienable parts, which are regularly or easily removed or exuded, or which refer to things added to a manufactured object.

This meaning is shown to be semantically appropriate for all of the contexts (conditional clauses, questions, initial negatives, ‘other openers’ and wishes) in which inversion appears. The importance of discourse context is stressed. Cases of pseudo‐auxiliary inversion, involving be and have, are explained.",Australian Journal of Linguistics

It is the object of this essay to suggest how — as far, at any rate, as concerns primary-pattern verb clusters A treatment of tense covering secondary-pattern verb clusters as well would require a vastly longer essay English verb clusters divide into those of the PRIMARY PATTERN and those of the SECONDARY PATTERN, the former being all and only those not incorporating a secondary auxiliary (Palmer 1974:30ff, 94ff) The secondary auxiliaries are will, would, shall, should, can, could, may, might, must, ought and two or three others The point of the segregation is that secondary-pattern verb clusters are systematically one word longer than primary-pattern ones — a syntactical fact which can hardly lack semantic significance",Australian Journal of Linguistics
